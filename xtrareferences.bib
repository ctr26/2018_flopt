  abstract = {Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has been present in cell biology laboratories for quite some time, mainly as custom-made systems, with imaging applications ranging from single cells (in the micrometer scale) to small organisms (in the millimeter scale). Such microscopes distinguish themselves for having very low phototoxicity levels and high spatial and temporal resolution, properties that make them ideal for a large range of applications, including the study of dynamic processes in cell biology. In particular, cellular motion has proven to be essential in biological processes such as tumor metastasis and tissue development. Experimental setups make extensive use of microdevices (bioMEMS) that provide better control over the substrate environment than traditional cell culture experiments. For example, to mimic in vivo conditions, experiment biochemical dynamics, and trap, move or count cells. Microdevices provide higher degrees of empirical complexity but, so far, most have been designed to be imaged through wide-field or confocal microscopes. However, the properties of LSFM render it ideal for 3D characterization of active cells. When working with microdevices, confocal microscopy is more widespread than LSFM even though it suffers from higher phototoxicity and slower acquisition speeds. Although it is sometimes possible to illuminate with a light sheet microdevices designed for confocal microscopes, these bioMEMS must be redesigned to exploit the full potential of LSFM. These properties are essential to image phenomena such as motion and traction, differentiation, and diffusion of molecules more frequently on a wider scale. The use of microdevices for LSFM has extended beyond cell tracking studies into experiments regarding cytometry, spheroid cultures and lab-on-a-chip automation. Due to light sheet microscopy being in its early stages, a setup of these characteristics demands some degree of optical expertise; and designing three-dimensional microdevices requires facilities, ingenuity and experience in microfabrication. In this paper, we explore different approaches where light sheet microscopy can achieve single-cell and subcellular resolution within microdevices, and provide a few pointers on how these experiments may be improved.},

  abstract = {We have developed a new open-top selective plane illumination microscope (SPIM) compatible with microfluidic devices, multi-well plates, and other sample formats used in conventional inverted microscopy. Its key element is a water prism that compensates for the aberrations introduced when imaging at 45 degrees through a coverglass. We have demonstrated its unique high-content imaging capability by recording Drosophila embryo development in environmentally-controlled microfluidic channels and imaging zebrafish embryos in 96-well plates. We have also shown the imaging of C. elegans and moving Drosophila larvae on coverslips.},

  abstract = {We present a sensitive inverted light sheet microscope, capable of single-molecule fluorescence imaging of cells in 96-well plates. Light sheet microscope designs are often complex and costly, requiring custom-made sample chambers that are incompatible with standard cell culture samples. To overcome this limitation, we have developed single-objective cantilever selective plane illumination microscopy (socSPIM), which introduces a light sheet through the objective lens of an inverted microscope using an AFM tip. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this setup by performing 3D imaging of nuclear pore complexes, as well as live whole-cell 3D imaging of lysosomes and super-resolution imaging of the T-cell membrane. The unique advantage offered by socSPIM is the minimal footprint of the cantilever, which allowed us to perform super-resolution reflected light-sheet microscopy by PAINT in 96-well plates, paving the way for high-throughput studies.},
