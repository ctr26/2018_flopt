  abstract = {In optical microscopy, fine structural details are resolved by using refraction to magnify images of a specimen. We discovered that by synthesizing a swellable polymer network within a specimen, it can be physically expanded, resulting in physical magnification. By covalently anchoring specific labels located within the specimen directly to the polymer network, labels spaced closer than the optical diffraction limit can be isotropically separated and optically resolved, a process we call expansion microscopy (ExM). Thus, this process can be used to perform scalable superresolution microscopy with diffraction-limited microscopes. We demonstrate ExM with apparent \textasciitilde 70-nanometer lateral resolution in both cultured cells and brain tissue, performing three-color superresolution imaging of \textasciitilde 107 cubic micrometers of the mouse hippocampus with a conventional confocal microscope.},

  abstract = {The use of structured illumination in fluorescence microscopy allows the suppression of out of focus light and an increase in effective spatial resolution. In this paper we consider different approaches for reconstructing 2D structured illumination images in order to combine these two attributes, to allow fast, optically sectioned, superresolution imaging. We present a linear reconstruction method that maximizes the axial frequency extent of the combined 2D structured illumination passband along with an empirically optimized approximation to this scheme. These reconstruction methods are compared to other schemes using structured illumination images of fluorescent samples. For sinusoidal excitation at half the incoherent cutoff frequency we find that removing information in the zero order passband except for a small region close to the excitation frequency, where it replaces the complementary information from the displaced first order passband, enables optimal reconstruction of optically sectioned images with enhanced spatial resolution.},

  abstract = {In this Letter, we present an analysis of the effects of polarization state on the pattern contrast in a structured illumination microscope. Using vectorial ray tracing methods, we show that the contrast varies nonmonotonically with both the numerical aperture of the microscope objective lens and the orientation of the electric field with respect to the meridional plane. By careful selection of these two parameters, high pattern contrast can be obtained without polarization rotation, reducing the cost and complexity of structured illumination imaging systems and increasing light throughput and imaging speed. We present experimental results that show good agreement with theoretical predictions and discuss the implications for super-resolution imaging.},
