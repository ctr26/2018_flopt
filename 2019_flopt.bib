  abstract = {A new technique termed Helical Optical Projection Tomography (hOPT) has been developed with the aim to overcome some of the limitations of current 3D optical imaging techniques. hOPT is based on Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) with the major difference that there is a translation of the sample in the vertical direction during the image acquisition process, requiring a new approach to image reconstruction. Contrary to OPT, hOPT makes possible to obtain 3D-optical images of intact long samples without imposing limits on the sample length. This has been tested using hOPT to image long murine tissue samples such as spinal cords and large intestines. Moreover, 3D-reconstructed images of the colon of DSS-treated mice, a model for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, allowed the identification of the structural alterations. Finally, the geometry of the hOPT device facilitates the addition of a Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) arm, providing the possibility of delivering high resolution images of selected areas together with complete volumetric information.},

  abstract = {Finding the center of rotation is an essential step for accurate three-dimensional reconstruction in optical projection tomography (OPT). Unfortunately current methods are not convenient since they require either prior scanning of a reference phantom, small structures of high intensity existing in the specimen, or active participation during the centering procedure. To solve these problems this paper proposes a fast and automatic center of rotation search method making use of parallel programming in graphics processing units (GPUs). Our method is based on a two step search approach making use only of those sections of the image with high signal to noise ratio. We have tested this method both in non-scattering ex vivo samples and in in vivo specimens with a considerable contribution of scattering such as Drosophila melanogaster pupae, recovering in all cases the center of rotation with a precision 1/4 pixel or less.},

  abstract = {Optical projection tomography (OPT) is a 3D imaging alternative to conventional microscopy which allows imaging of millimeter-sized object with isotropic micrometer resolution. The zebrafish is an established model organism and an important tool used in genetic and chemical screening. The size and optical transparency of the embryo and larva makes them well suited for imaging using OPT. Here, we present an open-source implementation of an OPT platform, built around a customized sample stage, 3D-printed parts and open source algorithms optimized for the system. We developed a versatile automated workflow including a two-step image processing approach for correcting the center of rotation and generating accurate 3D reconstructions. Our results demonstrate high-quality 3D reconstruction using synthetic data as well as real data of live and fixed zebrafish. The presented 3D-printable OPT platform represents a fully open design, low-cost and rapid loading and unloading of samples. Our system offers the opportunity for researchers with different backgrounds to setup and run OPT for large scale experiments, particularly in studies using zebrafish larvae as their key model organism.},
