@ARTICLE{arranzHelicalOpticalProjection2013,
  ABSTRACT = {A new technique termed Helical Optical Projection Tomography (hOPT) has been developed with the aim to overcome some of the limitations of current 3D optical imaging techniques. hOPT is based on Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) with the major difference that there is a translation of the sample in the vertical direction during the image acquisition process, requiring a new approach to image reconstruction. Contrary to OPT, hOPT makes possible to obtain 3D-optical images of intact long samples without imposing limits on the sample length. This has been tested using hOPT to image long murine tissue samples such as spinal cords and large intestines. Moreover, 3D-reconstructed images of the colon of DSS-treated mice, a model for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, allowed the identification of the structural alterations. Finally, the geometry of the hOPT device facilitates the addition of a Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM) arm, providing the possibility of delivering high resolution images of selected areas together with complete volumetric information.},

@ARTICLE{bracewellStripIntegrationRadio1956,
  ABSTRACT = {When a celestial source of radio waves is scanned with an aerial beam which is much longer than the source in one direction but suitably narrow in the other, the transformation from the true distribution to the measured value is referred to as strip integration. It is here treated as a special case of two-dimensional aerial smoothing in which the aerial beam is allowed to spin about its centre as it moves about the sky. It is shown that the resolution obtainable is set by the cross-sectional profile of the strip beam in the narrow dimension. Thus, when the strip reduces to a line, the resolution is complete and full reconstruction of the true distribution is possible; but scans must be made in all directions. In the general case it is shown that there is a principal solution, and that a finite number of scans suffices to determine it. A method is presented for reconstructing the principal solution from the observed data.},

  ABSTRACT = {Finding the center of rotation is an essential step for accurate three-dimensional reconstruction in optical projection tomography (OPT). Unfortunately current methods are not convenient since they require either prior scanning of a reference phantom, small structures of high intensity existing in the specimen, or active participation during the centering procedure. To solve these problems this paper proposes a fast and automatic center of rotation search method making use of parallel programming in graphics processing units (GPUs). Our method is based on a two step search approach making use only of those sections of the image with high signal to noise ratio. We have tested this method both in non-scattering ex vivo samples and in in vivo specimens with a considerable contribution of scattering such as Drosophila melanogaster pupae, recovering in all cases the center of rotation with a precision 1/4 pixel or less.},

@ARTICLE{zhangZOPTOpenSource2020,
  ABSTRACT = {Optical projection tomography (OPT) is a 3D imaging alternative to conventional microscopy which allows imaging of millimeter-sized object with isotropic micrometer resolution. The zebrafish is an established model organism and an important tool used in genetic and chemical screening. The size and optical transparency of the embryo and larva makes them well suited for imaging using OPT. Here, we present an open-source implementation of an OPT platform, built around a customized sample stage, 3D-printed parts and open source algorithms optimized for the system. We developed a versatile automated workflow including a two-step image processing approach for correcting the center of rotation and generating accurate 3D reconstructions. Our results demonstrate high-quality 3D reconstruction using synthetic data as well as real data of live and fixed zebrafish. The presented 3D-printable OPT platform represents a fully open design, low-cost and rapid loading and unloading of samples. Our system offers the opportunity for researchers with different backgrounds to setup and run OPT for large scale experiments, particularly in studies using zebrafish larvae as their key model organism.},

@ARTICLE{fischlerRandomSampleConsensus1981,
  ABSTRACT = {A new paradigm, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC), for fitting a model to experimental data is introduced. RANSAC is capable of interpreting/smoothing data containing a significant percentage of gross errors, and is thus ideally suited for applications in automated image analysis where interpretation is based on the data provided by error-prone feature detectors. A major portion of this paper describes the application of RANSAC to the Location Determination Problem (LDP): Given an image depicting a set of landmarks with known locations, determine that point in space from which the image was obtained. In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form. These results provide the basis for an automatic system that can solve the LDP under difficult viewing},

@ARTICLE{loweDistinctiveImageFeatures2004,
  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a method for extracting distinctive invariant features from images that can be used to perform reliable matching between different views of an object or scene. The features are invariant to image scale and rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a single feature can be correctly matched with high probability against a large database of features from many images. This paper also describes an approach to using these features for object recognition. The recognition proceeds by matching individual features to a database of features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify clusters belonging to a single object, and finally performing verification through least-squares solution for consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion while achieving near real-time performance.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{loweObjectRecognitionLocal1999,
  ABSTRACT = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low residual least squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

  ABSTRACT = {Humans perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem and what is the current state of the art? Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging, and for fun, consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos. More than just a source of “recipes,” this exceptionally authoritative and comprehensive textbook/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting them to produce descriptions of a scene. These problems are also analyzed using statistical models and solved using rigorous engineering techniques Topics and features: Structured to support active curricula and project-oriented courses, with tips in the Introduction for using the book in a variety of customized courses Presents exercises at the end of each chapter with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms and containing numerous suggestions for small mid-term projects Provides additional material and more detailed mathematical topics in the Appendices, which cover linear algebra, numerical techniques, and Bayesian estimation theory Suggests additional reading at the end of each chapter, including the latest research in each sub-field, in addition to a full Bibliography at the end of the book Supplies supplementary course material for students at the associated website, http://szeliski.org/Book/ Suitable for an upper-level undergraduate or graduate-level course in computer science or engineering, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries. Its design and exposition also make it eminently suitable as a unique reference to the fundamental techniques and current research literature in computer vision.},

  ABSTRACT = {In optical microscopy, fine structural details are resolved by using refraction to magnify images of a specimen. We discovered that by synthesizing a swellable polymer network within a specimen, it can be physically expanded, resulting in physical magnification. By covalently anchoring specific labels located within the specimen directly to the polymer network, labels spaced closer than the optical diffraction limit can be isotropically separated and optically resolved, a process we call expansion microscopy (ExM). Thus, this process can be used to perform scalable superresolution microscopy with diffraction-limited microscopes. We demonstrate ExM with apparent \textasciitilde 70-nanometer lateral resolution in both cultured cells and brain tissue, performing three-color superresolution imaging of \textasciitilde 107 cubic micrometers of the mouse hippocampus with a conventional confocal microscope.},

  ABSTRACT = {The use of structured illumination in fluorescence microscopy allows the suppression of out of focus light and an increase in effective spatial resolution. In this paper we consider different approaches for reconstructing 2D structured illumination images in order to combine these two attributes, to allow fast, optically sectioned, superresolution imaging. We present a linear reconstruction method that maximizes the axial frequency extent of the combined 2D structured illumination passband along with an empirically optimized approximation to this scheme. These reconstruction methods are compared to other schemes using structured illumination images of fluorescent samples. For sinusoidal excitation at half the incoherent cutoff frequency we find that removing information in the zero order passband except for a small region close to the excitation frequency, where it replaces the complementary information from the displaced first order passband, enables optimal reconstruction of optically sectioned images with enhanced spatial resolution.},

  ABSTRACT = {In this Letter, we present an analysis of the effects of polarization state on the pattern contrast in a structured illumination microscope. Using vectorial ray tracing methods, we show that the contrast varies nonmonotonically with both the numerical aperture of the microscope objective lens and the orientation of the electric field with respect to the meridional plane. By careful selection of these two parameters, high pattern contrast can be obtained without polarization rotation, reducing the cost and complexity of structured illumination imaging systems and increasing light throughput and imaging speed. We present experimental results that show good agreement with theoretical predictions and discuss the implications for super-resolution imaging.},

We crafted ultrathin light sheets from two-dimensional optical lattices that allowed us to image three-dimensional (3D) dynamics for hundreds of volumes, often at subsecond intervals, at the diffraction limit and beyond. We applied this to systems spanning four orders of magnitude in space and time, including the diffusion of single transcription factor molecules in stem cell spheroids, the dynamic instability of mitotic microtubules, the immunological synapse, neutrophil motility in a 3D matrix, and embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster.

@ARTICLE{tomerAdvancedCLARITYRapid2014,
  ABSTRACT = {CLARITY is a method for chemical transformation of intact biological tissues into a hydrogel-tissue hybrid, which becomes amenable to interrogation with light and macromolecular labels while retaining fine structure and native biological molecules. This emerging accessibility of information from large intact samples has created both new opportunities and new challenges. Here we describe protocols spanning multiple dimensions of the CLARITY workflow, ranging from simple, reliable and efficient lipid removal without electrophoretic instrumentation (passive CLARITY) to optimized objectives and integration with light-sheet optics (CLARITY-optimized light-sheet microscopy (COLM)) for accelerating data collection from clarified samples by several orders of magnitude while maintaining or increasing quality and resolution. The entire protocol takes from 7–28 d to complete for an adult mouse brain, including hydrogel embedding, full lipid removal, whole-brain antibody staining (which, if needed, accounts for 7–10 of the days), and whole-brain high-resolution imaging; timing within this window depends on the choice of lipid removal options, on the size of the tissue, and on the number and type of immunostaining rounds performed. This protocol has been successfully applied to the study of adult mouse, adult zebrafish and adult human brains, and it may find many other applications in the structural and molecular analysis of large assembled biological systems.},

@ARTICLE{hillMECsBuildingBlocks2016,
  ABSTRACT = {The development of new biological and chemical instruments for research and diagnostic applications is often slowed by the cost, specialization, and custom nature of these instruments. New instruments are built from components that are drawn from a host of different disciplines and not designed to integrate together, and once built, an instrument typically performs a limited number of tasks and cannot be easily adapted for new applications. Consequently, the process of inventing new instruments is very inefficient, especially for researchers or clinicians in resource-limited settings. To improve this situation, we propose that a family of standardized multidisciplinary components is needed, a set of “building blocks” that perform a wide array of different tasks and are designed to integrate together. Using these components, scientists, engineers, and clinicians would be able to build custom instruments for their own unique needs quickly and easily. In this work we present the foundation of this set of components, a system we call Multifluidic Evolutionary Components (MECs). “Multifluidic” conveys the wide range of fluid volumes MECs operate upon (from nanoliters to milliliters and beyond); “multi” also reflects the multiple disciplines supported by the system (not only fluidics but also electronics, optics, and mechanics). “Evolutionary” refers to the design principles that enable the library of MEC parts to easily grow and adapt to new applications. Each MEC “building block” performs a fundamental function that is commonly found in biological or chemical instruments, functions like valving, pumping, mixing, controlling, and sensing. Each MEC also has a unique symbol linked to a physical definition, which enables instruments to be designed rapidly and efficiently using schematics. As a proof-of-concept, we use MECs to build a variety of instruments, including a fluidic routing and mixing system capable of manipulating fluid volumes over five orders of magnitude, an acid-base titration instrument suitable for use in schools, and a bioreactor suitable for maintaining and analyzing cell cultures in research and diagnostic applications. These are the first of many instruments that can be built by researchers, clinicians, and students using the MEC system.},

  ABSTRACT = {The dynamics of molecules in living cells hampers precise imaging of molecular patterns by functional and super-resolution microscopy. We developed a method that circumvents lethal chemical fixation and allows on-stage cryo-arrest for consecutive imaging of molecular patterns within the same living, but arrested, cells. The reversibility of consecutive cryo-arrests was demonstrated by the high survival rate of different cell lines and by intact growth factor signaling that was not perturbed by stress response. Reversible cryo-arrest was applied to study the evolution of ligand-induced receptor tyrosine kinase activation at different scales. The nanoscale clustering of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the plasma membrane was assessed by single-molecule localization microscopy, and endosomal microscale activity patterns of ephrin receptor A2 (EphA2) were assessed by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Reversible cryo-arrest allows the precise determination of molecular patterns while conserving the dynamic capabilities of living cells.},

@ARTICLE{thorekCerenkovImagingNew2012,
  ABSTRACT = {Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) is an emerging hybrid modality that utilizes the light emission from many commonly used medical isotopes. Cerenkov radiation (CR) is produced when charged particles travel through a dielectric medium faster than the speed of light in that medium. First described in detail nearly 100 years ago, CR has only recently applied for biomedical imaging purposes. The modality is of considerable interest as it enables the use of widespread luminescence imaging equipment to visualize clinical diagnostic (all PET radioisotopes) and many therapeutic radionuclides. The amount of light detected in CLI applications is significantly lower than other that in other optical imaging techniques such as bioluminescence and fluorescence. However, significant advantages include the use of approved radiotracers and lack of an incident light source, resulting in high signal to background ratios. As well, multiple subjects may be imaged concurrently (up to 5 in common bioluminescent equipment), conferring both cost and time benefits. This review summarizes the field of Cerenkov luminescence imaging to date. Applications of CLI discussed include intraoperative radionuclide-guided surgery, monitoring of therapeutic efficacy, tomographic optical imaging capabilities, and the ability to perform multiplexed imaging using fluorophores excited by the Cerenkov radiation. While technical challenges still exist, Cerenkov imaging has materialized as an important molecular imaging modality.},

@ARTICLE{mitchellVivoCerenkovLuminescence2011,
  ABSTRACT = {Cerenkov radiation is a phenomenon where optical photons are emitted when a charged particle moves faster than the speed of light for the medium in which it travels. Recently, we and others have discovered that measurable visible light due to the Cerenkov effect is produced in vivo following the administration of β-emitting radionuclides to small animals. Furthermore, the amounts of injected activity required to produce a detectable signal are consistent with small-animal molecular imaging applications. This surprising observation has led to the development of a new hybrid molecular imaging modality known as Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI), which allows the spatial distribution of biomolecules labelled with β-emitting radionuclides to be imaged in vivo using sensitive charge-coupled device cameras. We review the physics of Cerenkov radiation as it relates to molecular imaging, present simulation results for light intensity and spatial distribution, and show an example of CLI in a mouse cancer model. CLI allows many common radiotracers to be imaged in widely available in vivo optical imaging systems, and, more importantly, provides a pathway for directly imaging β−-emitting radionuclides that are being developed for therapeutic applications in cancer and that are not readily imaged by existing methods.},

  ABSTRACT = {Summary A major challenge in understanding the cellular diversity of the brain has been linking activity during behavior with standard cellular typology. For example, it has not been possible to determine whether principal neurons in prefrontal cortex active during distinct experiences represent separable cell types, and it is not known whether these differentially active cells exert distinct causal influences on behavior. Here, we develop quantitative hydrogel-based technologies to connect activity in cells reporting on behavioral experience with measures for both brain-wide wiring and molecular phenotype. We find that positive and negative-valence experiences in prefrontal cortex are represented by cell populations that differ in their causal impact on behavior, long-range wiring, and gene expression profiles, with the major discriminant being expression of the adaptation-linked gene NPAS4. These findings illuminate cellular logic of prefrontal cortex~information processing and natural adaptive behavior and may point the way to cell-type-specific understanding and treatment of disease-associated states.},

We introduce a pipeline for high-speed acquisition of brain activity at cellular resolution through profiling immediate early gene expression using immunostaining and light-sheet fluorescence imaging, followed by automated mapping and analysis of activity by an open-source software program we term ClearMap. We validate the pipeline first by analysis of brain regions activated in~response to haloperidol. Next, we report new cortical regions downstream of whisker-evoked sensory processing during active exploration. Last, we combine activity mapping with axon tracing to uncover new brain regions differentially activated during parenting behavior. This pipeline is widely applicable to different experimental paradigms, including animal species for which transgenic activity reporters are not readily available.},

  ABSTRACT = {T cells become activated when T-cell receptors (TCRs) recognize agonist peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex molecules on antigen-presenting cells. T-cell activation critically relies on the spatiotemporal arrangements of TCRs on the plasma membrane. However, the molecular organizations of TCRs on lymph node-resident T cells have not yet been determined, owing to the diffraction limit of light. Here we visualized nanometer- and micrometer-scale TCR distributions in lymph nodes by light sheet direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) and structured illumination microscopy (SIM). This dSTORM and SIM approach provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, of multiscale reorganization of TCRs during in vivo immune responses. We observed nanometer-scale plasma membrane domains, known as protein islands, on naïve T cells. These protein islands were enriched within micrometer-sized surface areas that we call territories. In vivo T-cell activation caused the TCR territories to contract, leading to the coalescence of protein islands and formation of stable TCR microclusters.},

  ABSTRACT = {A commentary onQuantitative neuroanatomy of all Purkinje cells with light sheet microscopy and high-throughput image analysisby Silvestri, L., Paciscopi, M., Soda, P., Biamonte, F., Iannello, G., Frasconi, P., and Pavone, F.S. (2015). Front. Neuroanat. 9:68. doi: 10.3389/fnana.2015.00068“Contemporary neuroscience is in urgent need of a new generation of neuroanatomical techniques allowing scalable, reliable, specific, and quantitative analysis of macroscopic portions of brain tissue with cellular or sub-cellular resolution.” In this first sentence of their Discussion, Silvestri et al (2015) succinctly set forth the key issues of their contributing article; namely, visualization of Purkinje cells in 3-D volumes, and the methods for doing so. The importance of rigorous quantitative analysis in neuroscience has long been recognized as an essential baseline against which to compare and interpret species differences, developmental changes, and pathological changes, among other processes. Counting, however, is not easy, and incorrect sampling methods have more than once produced fundamentally incorrect results – notably, the now discredited belief that there is no neuronal loss in normal aging (reviewed in Guillery, 2002), or that there are “ten times” more glia than neurons (reviewed in Hilgetag and Barbas, 2009). A particular challenge in neuroanatomy has been the problem of compiling accurate quantitative data about inherently 3-dimensional structures from essentially 2-dimensional histological sections. The standard way of dealing with this problem has been the application of specific stereological procedures. Even when combined with some degree of automation, however, stereology is notoriously labor intensive, and provides only limited information about spatial localization and pattern. A rapidly emerging alternative approach in quantitative neuroanatomy is direct 3-dimensional visualization. In itself, this is not new; for example, whole mount preparations reacted for various antigens have demonstrated an intricate compartmentalization of the cerebellar cortex (White et al., 2012; Cerminara et al., 2015); and reconstructed stacks of consecutive histology slides have successfully demonstrated the complex striosomal architecture (Mikula et al., 2009). The newer techniques, although not without their own problems, offer faster processing, better standardization, and the potential for integration across cellular and subcellular spatial scales.Several volumetric approaches are available. Serial two-photon tomography is a block-face approach developed in the early 2000’s and now in routine use for whole mouse brains (Ragan et al, 2012; Kim et al., 2015). The main features (reviewed in Amato et al., 2016) include straightforward specimen preparation, minimal tissue processing, automated and robust data acquisition, and high resolution 3-D reconstructions. In confocal light sheet microscopy (LSM), the approach used by Silvestri et al., the sample is illuminated with a thin sheet of light and optically sectioned, typically in a wide-field detection scheme. Millions of pixels are collected simultaneously by a camera instead of sequentially as in standard confocal or two-photon microscopy. Several modifications have been developed, each with some tradeoffs between the physical width of the lightsheet and the size of the specimen that can be imaged. Thin lightsheets (5µm -{$<$}1µm) provide the best axial resolution, but are limited to small samples. Physical specifications and configuration are reviewed in Silvestri et al, as well as in a number of other sources, reflecting the intense interest in this burgeoning field (Reynaud et al., 2015; Richardson and Lichtman, 2015; Santi, 2011; Tomer et al., 2015).LSM entails a number of interrelated steps, which are clearly detailed in Silvestri et al. As shown in their figure 1, the experimental pipeline for large-volume quantitative neuroanatomy consists of tissue clearing (for which there are a number of options; see also Richardson and Lichtman, 2015), actual imaging, image stitching, automatic cell localization, and further statistical analysis. None of these steps are routine and all are best viewed as still under development. The Authors are careful to emphasize that what they call large-scale quantitative neuroanatomy is still in its infancy (last paragraph of the Discussion) and requires both aggressive quality control and interactive testing of visualization and annotation tools. A major factor in the new pipeline is (for neuroscientists) the unaccustomedly huge size of the datasets, requiring sophisticated analysis capabilities and a disposition for multi-disciplinary interactions (see Reynaud et al., 2015: “The technology is ready to assist biologists in tackling scientific problems, but are biologists ready for it?”). On the positive side, these exigencies are encouraging the fast emergence of a new mindset, eager to accept the interdisciplinary challenges.Silvestri et al. take as a specific application the number and arrangement of Purkinje cells in the mouse cerebellum. This is an attractive target for multiple reasons: Purkinje cells are large, unambiguously identifiable by virtue of their size and location, they are moderately well-isolated, and variations have been reported in instances of human pathological conditions. The total number of Purkinje cells calculated in the selected P10 L7-GFP mouse is given as 221,107. This accords well with the estimates derived from unbiased stereology (e.g., Woodruff-Pak, 2006). Silvestri et al., report further geometric data, acquired by a clustering algorithm. Setting the number of nearest neighbors equal to 3, the Authors report that 94\% of identified Purkinje cells occur in large clusters, that 1131 clusters are made up of fewer than 100 cells, and that there are 1389 isolated neurons. This analysis is reminiscent of similar spatial analysis of apical dendritic bundles in cerebral cortex. In several studies, tangential sections through cortical layer 3 have revealed an organized array of dendritic clusters, containing about 50 dendrites in humans or 30 in macaque monkeys (Peters, 1994; Gabbott, 2003). This and other quantitative/pattern questions are well-suited to re-investigation with the new, faster protocols.In summary, large-scale quantitative neuroanatomy, via 3-D data acquisition and analysis, has emerged as an important new tool. More than tool, it is spearheading a welcome “user’s group”/new community with shared interests and priorities. The energy is palpable, and bodes well for renewed attention to basic neuroanatomical issues. It effectively rebuts, via standardization and quantification, the old accusation of neuroanatomy as “descriptive.” Major challenges undoubtedly lie ahead. Technical: can the current tradeoff of resolution and field width in LSM be narrowed? What are the effective ways for dealing with very large datasets? Sociological: how do we optimally combine the traditional small, PI driven lab with large centers or core facilities? Databases with ideas? Conceptual: What issues are the most tractable to this approach? How do we achieve more effective methodological integration; for example, gene expression data or receptor distribution along with cytoarchitecture? How do we incorporate cell type and connectivity data? How do we incorporate the temporal domain? Questions notwithstanding, this is an impressive new direction, and continued progress on all fronts can be expected.},

  ABSTRACT = {Optical clearing methods facilitate deep biological imaging by mitigating light scattering in situ. Multi-scale high-resolution imaging requires preservation of tissue integrity for accurate signal reconstruction. However, existing clearing reagents contain chemical components that could compromise tissue structure, preventing reproducible anatomical and fluorescence signal stability. We developed ScaleS, a sorbitol-based optical clearing method that provides stable tissue preservation for immunochemical labeling and three-dimensional (3D) signal rendering. ScaleS permitted optical reconstructions of aged and diseased brain in Alzheimer's disease models, including mapping of 3D networks of amyloid plaques, neurons and microglia, and multi-scale tracking of single plaques by successive fluorescence and electron microscopy. Human clinical samples from Alzheimer's disease patients analyzed via reversible optical re-sectioning illuminated plaque pathogenesis in the z axis. Comparative benchmarking of contemporary clearing agents showed superior signal and structure preservation by ScaleS. These findings suggest that ScaleS is a simple and reproducible method for accurate visualization of biological tissue. View full text},

@ARTICLE{cronan_clarity_2015,
  ABSTRACT = {Visualization of infection and the associated host response has been challenging in adult vertebrates. Owing to their transparency, zebrafish larvae have been used to directly observe infection in vivo ; however, such larvae have not yet developed a functional adaptive immune system. Cells involved in adaptive immunity mature later and have therefore been difficult to access optically in intact animals. Thus, the study of many aspects of vertebrate infection requires dissection of adult organs or ex vivo isolation of immune cells. Recently, CLARITY and PACT (passive clarity technique) methodologies have enabled clearing and direct visualization of dissected organs. Here, we show that these techniques can be applied to image host-pathogen interactions directly in whole animals. CLARITY and PACT-based clearing of whole adult zebrafish and Mycobacterium tuberculosis -infected mouse lungs enables imaging of mycobacterial granulomas deep within tissue to a depth of more than 1\hspace{0.25em}mm. Using established transgenic lines, we were able to image normal and pathogenic structures and their surrounding host context at high resolution. We identified the three-dimensional organization of granuloma-associated angiogenesis, an important feature of mycobacterial infection, and characterized the induction of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) within the granuloma using an established fluorescent reporter line. We observed heterogeneity in TNF induction within granuloma macrophages, consistent with an evolving view of the tuberculous granuloma as a non-uniform, heterogeneous structure. Broad application of this technique will enable new understanding of host-pathogen interactions in situ .},

  ABSTRACT = {Organism-level systems biology aims to identify, analyze, control and design cellular circuits in organisms. Many experimental and computational approaches have been developed over the years to allow us to conduct these studies. Some of the most powerful methods are based on using optical imaging in combination with fluorescent labeling, and for those one of the long-standing stumbling blocks has been tissue opacity. Recently, the solutions to this problem have started to emerge based on whole-body and whole-organ clearing techniques that employ innovative tissue-clearing chemistry. Here, we review these advancements and discuss how combining new clearing techniques with high-performing fluorescent proteins or small molecule tags, rapid volume imaging and efficient image informatics is resulting in comprehensive and quantitative organ-wide, single-cell resolution experimental data. These technologies are starting to yield information on connectivity and dynamics in cellular circuits at unprecedented resolution, and bring us closer to system-level understanding of physiology and diseases of complex mammalian systems.},

  ABSTRACT = {Although self-reconstructing beams have been the focus of many scientific studies over the past decade, hardly anything is known about their propagation and self-healing behaviour in a three-dimensional, inhomogeneous medium. The controlled reduction of scattering and beam spreading would enable a new illumination concept for light microscopes, particularly for those designed to look deep into scattering tissue. By investigating three different classes of refractive index inhomogeneity, using two large glass spheres, a cluster of smaller spheres and a piece of human skin, respectively, we show that beam self-reconstruction is indeed possible. We demonstrate that a Bessel beam is unexpectedly robust against deflection at objects, and we define measures for self-reconstruction in this context. We present a prototype of a microscope with self-reconstructing beams (MISERB) and show that a holographically shaped, scanned Bessel beam not only reduces scattering artefacts, but also simultaneously increases image quality and penetration depth in dense media.},

  ABSTRACT = {Within only a few short years, light sheet microscopy has contributed substantially to the emerging field of real-time developmental biology. Low photo-toxicity and high-speed multiview acquisition have made selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) a popular choice for studies of organ morphogenesis and function in zebrafish, Drosophila, and other model organisms. A multitude of different light sheet microscopes have emerged for the noninvasive imaging of specimens ranging from single molecules to cells, tissues, and entire embryos. In particular, developmental biology can benefit from the ability to watch developmental events occur in real time in an entire embryo, thereby advancing our understanding on how cells form tissues and organs. However, it presents a new challenge to our existing data and image processing tools. This review gives an overview of where we stand as light sheet microscopy branches out, explores new areas, and becomes more specialized.},

  ABSTRACT = {In vivo functional imaging at single-neuron resolution is an important approach to visualize biological processes in neuroscience. Light sheet microscopy (LSM) is a cutting edge in vivo imaging technique that provides micron-scale spatial resolution at high frame rate. Due to the scattering and absorption of tissue, however, conventional LSM is inadequate to resolve cells because of the attenuated signal to noise ratio (SNR). Using dual-beam illumination and confocal dual-slit detection, here a dual-slit confocal LSM is demonstrated to obtain the SNR enhanced images with frame rate twice as high as line confocal LSM method. Through theoretical calculations and experiments, the correlation between the slit’s width and SNR was determined to optimize the image quality. In vivo whole brain structural imaging stacks and the functional imaging sequences of single slice were obtained for analysis of calcium activities at single-cell resolution. A two-fold increase in imaging speed of conventional confocal LSM makes it possible to capture the sequence of the neurons’ activities and help reveal the potential functional connections in the whole zebrafish’s brain.},

  ABSTRACT = {The zebrafish Danio rerio has emerged as a powerful vertebrate model system that lends itself particularly well to quantitative investigations with live imaging approaches, owing to its exceptionally high optical clarity in embryonic and larval stages. Recent advances in light microscopy technology enable comprehensive analyses of cellular dynamics during zebrafish embryonic development, systematic mapping of gene expression dynamics, quantitative reconstruction of mutant phenotypes and the system-level biophysical study of morphogenesis., Despite these technical breakthroughs, it remains challenging to design and implement experiments for in vivo long-term imaging at high spatio-temporal resolution. This article discusses the fundamental challenges in zebrafish long-term live imaging, provides experimental protocols and highlights key prop1erties and capabilities of advanced fluorescence microscopes. The article focuses in particular on experimental assays based on light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy, an emerging imaging technology that achieves exceptionally high imaging speeds and excellent signal-to-noise ratios, while minimizing light-induced damage to the specimen. This unique combination of capabilities makes light sheet microscopy an indispensable tool for the in vivo long-term imaging of large developing organisms.},

  ABSTRACT = {Diffusion processes and local dynamic equilibria inside cells lead to nonuniform spatial distributions of molecules, which are essential for processes such as nuclear organization and signaling in cell division, differentiation and migration. To understand these mechanisms, spatially resolved quantitative measurements of protein abundance, mobilities and interactions are needed, but current methods have limited capabilities to study dynamic parameters. Here we describe a microscope based on light-sheet illumination that allows massively parallel fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements and use it to visualize the diffusion and interactions of proteins in mammalian cells and in isolated fly tissue. Imaging the mobility of heterochromatin protein HP1α (ref. 4) in cell nuclei we could provide high-resolution diffusion maps that reveal euchromatin areas with heterochromatin-like HP1α-chromatin interactions. We expect that FCS imaging will become a useful method for the precise characterization of cellular reaction-diffusion processes.},

@ARTICLE{iwashitaSystematicProfilingSpatiotemporal2014,
  ABSTRACT = {Accumulating evidence implicates the significance of the physical properties of the niche in influencing the behavior, growth and differentiation of stem cells. Among the physical properties, extracellular stiffness has been shown to have direct effects on fate determination in several cell types in vitro . However, little evidence exists concerning whether shifts in stiffness occur in vivo during tissue development. To address this question, we present a systematic strategy to evaluate the shift in stiffness in a developing tissue using the mouse embryonic cerebral cortex as an experimental model. We combined atomic force microscopy measurements of tissue and cellular stiffness with immunostaining of specific markers of neural differentiation to correlate the value of stiffness with the characteristic features of tissues and cells in the developing brain. We found that the stiffness of the ventricular and subventricular zones increases gradually during development. Furthermore, a peak in tissue stiffness appeared in the intermediate zone at E16.5. The stiffness of the cortical plate showed an initial increase but decreased at E18.5, although the cellular stiffness of neurons monotonically increased in association with the maturation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. These results indicate that tissue stiffness cannot be solely determined by the stiffness of the cells that constitute the tissue. Taken together, our method profiles the stiffness of living tissue and cells with defined characteristics and can therefore be utilized to further understand the role of stiffness as a physical factor that determines cell fate during the formation of the cerebral cortex and other tissues.},

@ARTICLE{gorelikQuantitativeUnbiasedAnalysis2014,
  ABSTRACT = {The mechanism by which cells control directional persistence during migration is a major question. However, the common index measuring directional persistence, namely the ratio of displacement to trajectory length, is biased, particularly by cell speed. An unbiased method is to calculate direction autocorrelation as a function of time. This function depends only on the angles of the vectors tangent to the trajectory. This method has not been widely used, because it is more difficult to compute. Here we discuss biases of the classical index and introduce a custom-made open-source computer program, DiPer, which calculates direction autocorrelation. In addition, DiPer also plots and calculates other essential parameters to analyze cell migration in two dimensions: it displays cell trajectories individually and collectively, and it calculates average speed and mean square displacements (MSDs) to assess the area explored by cells over time. This user-friendly program is executable through Microsoft Excel, and it generates plots of publication-level quality. The protocol takes ∼15 min to complete. We have recently used DiPer to analyze cell migration of three different mammalian cell types in 2D cultures: the mammary carcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231, the motile amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum and fish-scale keratocytes. DiPer can potentially be used not only for random migration in 2D but also for directed migration and for migration in 3D (direction autocorrelation only). Moreover, it can be used for any types of tracked particles: cellular organelles, bacteria and whole organisms.},

@ARTICLE{tahinciDistinctFunctionsRho2003,
  ABSTRACT = {We have undertaken the first detailed analysis of Rho GTPase function during vertebrate development by analyzing how RhoA and Rac1 control convergent extension of axial mesoderm during Xenopus gastrulation. Monitoring of a number of parameters in time-lapse recordings of mesoderm explants revealed that Rac and Rho have both distinct and overlapping roles in regulating the motility of axial mesoderm cells. The cell behaviors revealed by activated or inhibitory versions of these GTPases in native tissue were clearly distinct from those previously documented in cultured fibroblasts. The dynamic properties and polarity of protrusive activity, along with lamellipodia formation, were controlled by the two GTPases operating in a partially redundant manner, while Rho and Rac contributed separately to cell shape and filopodia formation. We propose that Rho and Rac operate in distinct signaling pathways that are integrated to control cell motility during convergent extension.},

  ABSTRACT = {Coordinated movement of large groups of cells is required for many biological processes, such as gastrulation and wound healing. During collective cell migration, cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions must be integrated so that cells maintain strong interactions with neighboring cells and the underlying substratum. Initiation and maintenance of cadherin adhesions at cell–cell junctions and integrin-based cell–ECM adhesions require integration of mechanical cues, dynamic regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, and input from specific signaling cascades, including Rho family GTPases. Here, we summarize recent advances made in understanding the interplay between these pathways at cadherin-based and integrin-based adhesions during collective cell migration and highlight outstanding questions that remain in the field.},

@ARTICLE{coleFearHoles2013,
  ABSTRACT = {Phobias are usually described as irrational and persistent fears of certain objects or situations, and causes of such fears are difficult to identify. We describe an unusual but common phobia (trypophobia), hitherto unreported in the scientific literature, in which sufferers are averse to images of holes. We performed a spectral analysis on a variety of images that induce trypophobia and found that the stimuli had a spectral composition typically associated with uncomfortable visual images, namely, high-contrast energy at midrange spatial frequencies. Critically, we found that a range of potentially dangerous animals also possess this spectral characteristic. We argue that although sufferers are not conscious of the association, the phobia arises in part because the inducing stimuli share basic visual characteristics with dangerous organisms, characteristics that are low level and easily computed, and therefore facilitate a rapid nonconscious response.},

  OPTIONS = {useprefix=true},
  ABSTRACT = {This study reports the design, realization, and characterization of a multi-pole magnetic tweezers that enables us to maneuver small magnetic probes inside living cells. So far, magnetic tweezers can be divided into two categories: I), tweezers that allow the exertion of high forces but consist of only one or two poles and therefore are capable of only exerting forces in one direction; and II), tweezers that consist of multiple poles and allow exertion of forces in multiple directions but at very low forces. The magnetic tweezers described here combines both aspects in a single apparatus: high forces in a controllable direction. To this end, micron scale magnetic structures are fabricated using cleanroom technologies. With these tweezers, magnetic flux gradients of ∇B = 8 × 103 T m−1 can be achieved over the dimensions of a single cell. This allows exertion of forces up to 12 pN on paramagnetic probes with a diameter of 350 nm, enabling us to maneuver them through the cytoplasm of a living cell. It is expected that with the current tweezers, picoNewton forces can be exerted on beads as small as 100 nm.},

We compare the theoretical localization precision for an unbiased estimator of the DH-PSF to that for 3D localization by astigmatic and biplane imaging using Fisher information analysis including pixelation and varying levels of background. The DH-PSF results in almost constant localization precision in all three dimensions for a 2 μm thick depth of field while astigmatism and biplane improve the axial localization precision over smaller axial ranges. For high signal-to-background ratio, the DH-PSF on average achieves better localization precision.},

  ABSTRACT = {Live imaging of large biological specimens is fundamentally limited by the short optical penetration depth of light microscopes. To maximize physical coverage, we developed the SiMView technology framework for high-speed in vivo imaging, which records multiple views of the specimen simultaneously. SiMView consists of a light-sheet microscope with four synchronized optical arms, real-time electronics for long-term sCMOS-based image acquisition at 175 million voxels per second, and computational modules for high-throughput image registration, segmentation, tracking and real-time management of the terabytes of multiview data recorded per specimen. We developed one-photon and multiphoton SiMView implementations and recorded cellular dynamics in entire Drosophila melanogaster embryos with 30-s temporal resolution throughout development. We furthermore performed high-resolution long-term imaging of the developing nervous system and followed neuroblast cell lineages in vivo. SiMView data sets provide quantitative morphological information even for fast global processes and enable accurate automated cell tracking in the entire early embryo.},

Our approach achieves on average 97.0\% linkage accuracy across all species and imaging modalities. Using our system, we performed the first cell lineage reconstruction of early Drosophila melanogaster nervous system development, revealing neuroblast dynamics throughout an entire embryo.},

We developed an approach, multiangle image acquisition, three-dimensional reconstruction and cell segmentation–automated lineage tracking (MARS-ALT), in which we imaged whole organs from multiple angles, computationally merged and segmented these images to provide accurate cell identification in three dimensions and automatically tracked cell lineages through multiple rounds of cell division during development. Using these methods, we quantitatively analyzed Arabidopsis thaliana flower development at cell resolution, which revealed differential growth patterns of key regions during early stages of floral morphogenesis.

@ARTICLE{mosaligantiACMEAutomatedCell2012,
  ABSTRACT = {The quantification of cell shape, cell migration, and cell rearrangements is important for addressing classical questions in developmental biology such as patterning and tissue morphogenesis. Time-lapse microscopic imaging of transgenic embryos expressing fluorescent reporters is the method of choice for tracking morphogenetic changes and establishing cell lineages and fate maps in vivo . However, the manual steps involved in curating thousands of putative cell segmentations have been a major bottleneck in the application of these technologies especially for cell membranes. Segmentation of cell membranes while more difficult than nuclear segmentation is necessary for quantifying the relations between changes in cell morphology and morphogenesis. We present a novel and fully automated method to first reconstruct membrane signals and then segment out cells from 3D membrane images even in dense tissues. The approach has three stages: 1) detection of local membrane planes, 2) voting to fill structural gaps, and 3) region segmentation. We demonstrate the superior performance of the algorithms quantitatively on time-lapse confocal and two-photon images of zebrafish neuroectoderm and paraxial mesoderm by comparing its results with those derived from human inspection. We also compared with synthetic microscopic images generated by simulating the process of imaging with fluorescent reporters under varying conditions of noise. Both the over-segmentation and under-segmentation percentages of our method are around 5\%. The volume overlap of individual cells, compared to expert manual segmentation, is consistently over 84\%. By using our software (ACME) to study somite formation, we were able to segment touching cells with high accuracy and reliably quantify changes in morphogenetic parameters such as cell shape and size, and the arrangement of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Our software has been developed and tested on Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms and is available publicly under an open source BSD license ( https://github.com/krm15/ACME ).},

  ABSTRACT = {Summary The microenvironment determines cell behavior, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood because quantitative studies of cell signaling and behavior have been challenging due to insufficient spatial and/or temporal resolution and limitations on microenvironmental control. Here we introduce microenvironmental selective plane illumination microscopy (meSPIM) for imaging and quantification of intracellular signaling and submicrometer cellular structures as well as large-scale cell morphological and environmental features. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by showing that the mechanical properties of the microenvironment regulate the transition of melanoma cells from actin-driven protrusion to blebbing, and we present tools to quantify how cells manipulate individual collagen fibers. We leverage the nearly isotropic resolution of meSPIM to quantify the local concentration of actin and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling on the surfaces of cells deep within 3D collagen matrices and track the many small membrane protrusions that appear in these more physiologically relevant environments.},

@ARTICLE{naikActiveMachineLearningdriven2016,
  ABSTRACT = {Biomedical scientists have invested significant effort into making it easy to perform lots of experiments quickly and cheaply. These “high throughput” methods are the workhorses of modern “systems biology” efforts. However, we simply cannot perform an experiment for every possible combination of different cell type, genetic mutation and other conditions. In practice this has led researchers to either exhaustively test a few conditions or targets, or to try to pick the experiments that best allow a particular problem to be explored. But which experiments should we pick? The ones we think we can predict the outcome of accurately, the ones for which we are uncertain what the results will be, or a combination of the two? Humans are not particularly well suited for this task because it requires reasoning about many possible outcomes at the same time. However, computers are much better at handling statistics for many experiments, and machine learning algorithms allow computers to “learn” how to make predictions and decisions based on the data they’ve previously processed. Previous computer simulations showed that a machine learning approach termed “active learning” could do a good job of picking a series of experiments to perform in order to efficiently learn a model that predicts the results of experiments that were not done. Now, Naik et al. have performed cell biology experiments in which experiments were chosen by an active learning algorithm and then performed using liquid handling robots and an automated microscope. The key idea behind the approach is that you learn more from an experiment you can’t predict (or that you predicted incorrectly) than from just confirming your confident predictions. The results of the robot-driven experiments showed that the active learning approach outperforms strategies a human might use, even when the potential outcomes of individual experiments are not known beforehand. The next challenge is to apply these methods to reduce the cost of achieving the goals of large projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

In particular, LSFM has been instrumental in revealing the detail of early embryonic development of Zebrafish, Drosophila, and C. elegans. Open access projects, DIY-SPIM, OpenSPIM, and OpenSPIN, now allow LSFM to be set-up easily and at low cost. The aim of this paper is to facilitate the set-up and use of LSFM by reviewing and comparing open access projects, image processing tools and future challenges.},

Single-virus tracking in living cells potentially provides us with the means to visualize the virus journey. This approach allows us to follow the fate of individual virus particles and monitor dynamic interactions between viruses and cellular structures, revealing previously unobservable infection steps. The entry, trafficking and egress mechanisms of various animal viruses have been elucidated using this method. The combination of single-virus trafficking with systems approaches and state-of-the-art imaging technologies should prove exciting in the future.},

  ABSTRACT = {Light-sheet microscopy is a powerful method for imaging the development and function of complex biological systems at high spatiotemporal resolution and over long time scales. Such experiments typically generate terabytes of multidimensional image data, and thus they demand efficient computational solutions for data management, processing and analysis. We present protocols and software to tackle these steps, focusing on the imaging-based study of animal development. Our protocols facilitate (i) high-speed lossless data compression and content-based multiview image fusion optimized for multicore CPU architectures, reducing image data size 30-500-fold; (ii) automated large-scale cell tracking and segmentation; and (iii) visualization, editing and annotation of multiterabyte image data and cell-lineage reconstructions with tens of millions of data points. These software modules are open source. They provide high data throughput using a single computer workstation and are readily applicable to a wide spectrum of biological model systems.},

  ABSTRACT = {A key requirement for performing three-dimensional (3D) imaging using optical microscopes is that they be capable of optical sectioning by distinguishing in-focus signal from out-of-focus background. Common techniques for fluorescence optical sectioning are confocal laser scanning microscopy and two-photon microscopy. But there is increasing interest in alternative optical sectioning techniques, particularly for applications involving high speeds, large fields of view or long-term imaging. In this Review, I examine two such techniques, based on planar illumination or structured illumination. The goal is to describe the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques.},

  ABSTRACT = {Visualizing entire neuronal networks for analysis in the intact brain has been impossible up to now. Techniques like computer tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) do not yield cellular resolution, and mechanical slicing procedures are insufficient to achieve high-resolution reconstructions in three dimensions. Here we present an approach that allows imaging of whole fixed mouse brains. We modified 'ultramicroscopy' by combining it with a special procedure to clear tissue. We show that this new technique allows optical sectioning of fixed mouse brains with cellular resolution and can be used to detect single GFP-labeled neurons in excised mouse hippocampi. We obtained three-dimensional (3D) images of dendritic trees and spines of populations of CA1 neurons in isolated hippocampi. Also in fruit flies and in mouse embryos, we were able to visualize details of the anatomy by imaging autofluorescence. Our method is ideally suited for high-throughput phenotype screening of transgenic mice and thus will benefit the investigation of disease models},

  ABSTRACT = {Brain function relies on communication between large populations of neurons across multiple brain areas, a full understanding of which would require knowledge of the time-varying activity of all neurons in the central nervous system. Here we use light-sheet microscopy to record activity, reported through the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP5G, from the entire volume of the brain of the larval zebrafish in vivo at 0.8 Hz, capturing more than 80\% of all neurons at single-cell resolution. Demonstrating how this technique can be used to reveal functionally defined circuits across the brain, we identify two populations of neurons with correlated activity patterns. One circuit consists of hindbrain neurons functionally coupled to spinal cord neuropil. The other consists of an anatomically symmetric population in the anterior hindbrain, with activity in the left and right halves oscillating in antiphase, on a timescale of 20 s, and coupled to equally slow oscillations in the inferior olive.},

  ABSTRACT = {Misfolding and aggregation of amyloidogenic polypeptides lie at the root of many neurodegenerative diseases. Whilst protein aggregation can be readily studied in vitro by established biophysical techniques, direct observation of the nature and kinetics of aggregation processes taking place in vivo is much more challenging. We describe here, however, a Förster resonance energy transfer sensor that permits the aggregation kinetics of amyloidogenic proteins to be quantified in living systems by exploiting our observation that amyloid assemblies can act as energy acceptors for variants of fluorescent proteins. The observed lifetime reduction can be attributed to fluorescence energy transfer to intrinsic energy states associated with the growing amyloid species. Indeed, for a-synuclein, a protein whose aggregation is linked to Parkinson's disease, we have used this sensor to follow the kinetics of the self-association reactions taking place in vitro and in vivo and to reveal the nature of the ensuing aggregated species. Experiments were conducted in vitro, in cells in culture and in living Caenorhabditis elegans. For the latter the readout correlates directly with the appearance of a toxic phenotype. The ability to measure the appearance and development of pathogenic amyloid species in a living animal and the ability to relate such data to similar processes observed in vitro provides a powerful new tool in the study of the pathology of the family of misfolding disorders. Our study confirms the importance of the molecular environment in which aggregation reactions take place, highlighting similarities as well as differences between the processes occurring in vitro and in vivo, and their significance for defining the molecular physiology of the diseases with which they are associated.},

  ABSTRACT = {We describe the construction and use of a compact dual-view inverted selective plane illumination microscope (diSPIM) for time-lapse volumetric (4D) imaging of living samples at subcellular resolution. Our protocol enables a biologist with some prior microscopy experience to assemble a diSPIM from commercially available parts, to align optics and test system performance, to prepare samples, and to control hardware and data processing with our software. Unlike existing light sheet microscopy protocols, our method does not require the sample to be embedded in agarose; instead, samples are prepared conventionally on glass coverslips. Tissue culture cells and Caenorhabditis elegans embryos are used as examples in this protocol; successful implementation of the protocol results in isotropic resolution and acquisition speeds up to several volumes per s on these samples. Assembling and verifying diSPIM performance takes ∼6 d, sample preparation and data acquisition take up to 5 d and postprocessing takes 3-8 h, depending on the size of the data.},

  ABSTRACT = {Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) functions as a non-destructive microtome and microscope that uses a plane of light to optically section and view tissues with subcellular resolution. This method is well suited for imaging deep within transparent tissues or within whole organisms, and because tissues are exposed to only a thin plane of light, specimen photobleaching and phototoxicity are minimized compared to wide-field fluorescence, confocal, or multiphoton microscopy. LSFMs produce well-registered serial sections that are suitable for three-dimensional reconstruction of tissue structures. Because of a lack of a commercial LSFM microscope, numerous versions of light sheet microscopes have been constructed by different investigators. This review describes development of the technology, reviews existing devices, provides details of one LSFM device, and shows examples of images and three-dimensional reconstructions of tissues that were produced by LSFM.},

@THESIS{andersonImagingThreeDimensional2009,
  ABSTRACT = {Networks of neurons give rise to behavior in complex animals. Determining the relationship between neural activity and sensory input or motor output requires recording network activity over time. Two properties contribute to the difficulty of recording from intact biological neural networks: first, the component neurons are spread across the three-dimensional volume of the brain, and second, all neurons in the network may be active simultaneously. Recently, optical techniques have enabled monitoring activity across many neurons simultaneously. However, the recording range has been limited to the field of view of imaging device, generally the 2D focal plane of a camera or scanning laser system. In order to capture activity information across the full 3D extent of the network, multiple exposures must be acquired at different focal distances, which breaks the synchrony of the activity measurements. Here, I describe a novel neural imaging technique, called light field microscopy (LFM), which is capable of simultaneously recording the activity of many neurons across a volume of tissue. By measuring both the spatial and the angular properties of incoming photons, LFM is able to capture a 3D volume with a single camera exposure. To demonstrate the efficacy of LFM for neural recordings, I loaded the optic tectum of the transparent larval zebrafish with fluorescent calcium-indicator dye and presented the fish with high-contrast 2D visual stimuli. Using this preparation, LFM produces a 4D dataset (three spatial dimensions plus the time dimension) representing the visually-evoked activity patterns across a 3D network of neurons. In this dissertation, I describe the steps required for producing 4D neural activity datasets, and compare the resulting data to that obtained using a classic two-photon scanning laser microscope. The wealth of data captured by the LFM increases the complexity of analysis, and thus motivated the development of a statistical method for automatically isolating interesting parts of the dataset. The method, called elastic source selection (ESS), can determine the relevance over time of each captured voxel to an external stimulus. This dissertation establishes the effectiveness of the LFM and ESS techniques, providing neuroscientists a new avenue into the brain.},

  ABSTRACT = {3D live imaging is important for a better understanding of biological processes, but it is challenging with current techniques such as spinning-disk confocal microscopy. Bessel beam plane illumination microscopy allows high-speed 3D live fluorescence imaging of living cellular and multicellular specimens with nearly isotropic spatial resolution, low photobleaching and low photodamage. Unlike conventional fluorescence imaging techniques that usually have a unique operation mode, Bessel plane illumination has several modes that offer different performance with different imaging metrics. To achieve optimal results from this technique, the appropriate operation mode needs to be selected and the experimental setting must be optimized for the specific application and associated sample properties. Here we explain the fundamental working principles of this technique, discuss the pros and cons of each operational mode and show through examples how to optimize experimental parameters. We also describe the procedures needed to construct, align and operate a Bessel beam plane illumination microscope by using our previously reported system as an example, and we list the necessary equipment to build such a microscope. Assuming all components are readily available, it would take a person skilled in optical instrumentation ∼1 month to assemble and operate a microscope according to this protocol.},

@THESIS{zhengTimeSpectralResolvedFluorescence2011,
  ABSTRACT = {The combination of fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging provides a powerful approach to study the morphology and biochemistry of living biological systems. For example, fluorescence spectroscopic imaging technique offers the capability to reveal the important biochemical and morphological changes during pathological processes based on unique properties of fluorescent molecules such as spectral lineshape, lifetime and anisotropy. This dissertation aims to advance the current fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy techniques for employment in basic bioscience realm, and to translate these technologies to clinical diagnostic applications. Two specific biological questions are addressed, namely the application of autofluorescence to diagnose epithelial precancer, and the use of autofluorescence to extract microvasculature in tissue in vivo . In the study of fluorescence detection of precancer, we first investigated the feasibility of non-invasive monitoring cellular metabolism based on the time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. Then, we conducted a systematic study of the single- and two-photon excited autofluorescence from epithelial tissues. Finally, using a DMBA treated hamster cheek pouch model of oral cancer, we studied the noninvasive diagnosis of epithelial precancer based on multimodal two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging technique. Our study demonstrated that the morphological analysis of microscopic images provided both qualitative and quantitative assessments of the cancer development. The NADH fluorescence lifetime reduced with the carcinoma progression. Moreover, the nonlinear optical signals from collagen matrix provide diagnostic information for precancer differentiation. We recently discovered for the first time that hemoglobin, an essential protein molecule in blood, emits strong high-energy Soret fluorescence and can be potentially used as an endogenous contrast agent for imaging of microvasculature. We first characterized the spectral and lifetime properties of hemoglobin fluorescence by using a time-resolved spectroscopic imaging system. Then, the in vivo label-free three-dimensional imaging of microvasculature was performed based on the unique spectral and temporal characteristics of hemoglobin fluorescence. Finally, we explored the potential of in vivo label-free blood count based on the TPEF signals from hemoglobin in erythrocytes and tryptophan in leukocytes. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the multiphoton excitation fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy of endogenous agents has the tremendous potential to become a routine technique for life science research and clinical diagnosis of diseases.},

  ABSTRACT = {Since the work of Golgi and Cajal, light microscopy has remained a key tool for neuroscientists to observe cellular properties. Ongoing advances have enabled new experimental capabilities using light to inspect the nervous system across multiple spatial scales, including ultrastructural scales finer than the optical diffraction limit. Other progress permits functional imaging at faster speeds, at greater depths in brain tissue, and over larger tissue volumes than previously possible. Portable, miniaturized fluorescence microscopes now allow brain imaging in freely behaving mice. Complementary progress on animal preparations has enabled imaging in head-restrained behaving animals, as well as time-lapse microscopy studies in the brains of live subjects. Mouse genetic approaches permit mosaic and inducible fluorescence-labeling strategies, whereas intrinsic contrast mechanisms allow in vivo imaging of animals and humans without use of exogenous markers. This review surveys such advances and highlights emerging capabilities of particular interest to neuroscientists.},

  ABSTRACT = {Light-sheet-based fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is a fluorescence technique that combines optical sectioning, the key capability of confocal and two-photon fluorescence microscopes with multiple-view imaging, which is used in optical tomography. In contrast to conventional wide-field and confocal fluorescence microscopes, a light sheet illuminates only the focal plane of the detection objective lens from the side. Excitation is, thus, restricted to the fluorophores in the volume near the focal plane. This provides optical sectioning and allows the use of regular cameras in the detection process. Compared to confocal fluorescence microscopy, LSFM reduces photo bleaching and photo toxicity by up to three orders of magnitude. In LSFM, the specimen is embedded in a transparent block of hydrogel and positioned relative to the stationary light sheet using precise motorized translation and rotation stages. This feature is used to image any plane in a specimen. Additionally, multiple views obtained along different angles can be combined into a single data set with an improved resolution. LSFMs are very well suited for imaging large live specimens over long periods of time. However, they also perform well with very small specimens such as single yeast cells. This perspective introduces the principles of LSFM, explains the challenges of specimen preparation, and introduces the basics of a microscopy that takes advantage of multiple views.},

  ABSTRACT = {Optical microscopy has been a fundamental tool of biological discovery for more than three centuries, but its in vivo tissue imaging ability has been restricted by light scattering to superficial investigations, even when confocal or multiphoton methods are used. Recent advances in optical and optoacoustic (photoacoustic) imaging now allow imaging at depths and resolutions unprecedented for optical methods. These abilities are increasingly important to understand the dynamic interactions of cellular processes at different systems levels, a major challenge of postgenome biology. This Review discusses promising photonic methods that have the ability to visualize cellular and subcellular components in tissues across different penetration scales. The methods are classified into microscopic, mesoscopic and macroscopic approaches, according to the tissue depth at which they operate. Key characteristics associated with different imaging implementations are described and the potential of these technologies in biological applications is discussed.},

  ABSTRACT = {Novel technologies are required for three-dimensional cell biology and biophysics. By three-dimensional we refer to experimental conditions that essentially try to avoid hard and flat surfaces and favour unconstrained sample dynamics. We believe that light-sheet-based microscopes are particularly well suited to studies of sensitive three-dimensional biological systems. The application of such instruments can be illustrated with examples from the biophysics of microtubule dynamics and three-dimensional cell cultures. Our experience leads us to suggest that three-dimensional approaches reveal new aspects of a system and enable experiments to be performed in a more physiological and hence clinically more relevant context.},

@ARTICLE{donnertMacromolecularscaleResolutionBiological2006,
  ABSTRACT = {We demonstrate far-field fluorescence microscopy with a focal-plane resolution of 15–20 nm in biological samples. The 10- to 12-fold multilateral increase in resolution below the diffraction barrier has been enabled by the elimination of molecular triplet state excitation as a major source of photobleaching of a number of dyes in stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Allowing for relaxation of the triplet state between subsequent excitation–depletion cycles yields an up to 30-fold increase in total fluorescence signal as compared with reported stimulated emission depletion illumination schemes. Moreover, it enables the reduction of the effective focal spot area by up to ≈140-fold below that given by diffraction. Triplet-state relaxation can be realized either by reducing the repetition rate of pulsed lasers or by increasing the scanning speed such that the build-up of the triplet state is effectively prevented. This resolution in immunofluorescence imaging is evidenced by revealing nanoscale protein patterns on endosomes, the punctuated structures of intermediate filaments in neurons, and nuclear protein speckles in mammalian cells with conventional optics. The reported performance of diffraction-unlimited fluorescence microscopy opens up a pathway for addressing fundamental problems in the life sciences.},

  ABSTRACT = {In light sheet fluorescence microscopy optical sectioning is achieved by illuminating the sample orthogonally to the detection pathway with a thin, focused sheet of light. However, light scattering within the sample often deteriorates the optical sectioning effect. Here, we demonstrate that contrast and degree of confocality can greatly be increased by combining scanned light sheet fluorescence excitation and confocal slit detection. A high frame rate was achieved by using the "rolling shutter" of a scientific CMOS camera as a slit detector. Synchronizing the "rolling shutter" with the scanned illumination beam results in confocal line detection. Acquiring image data with selective plane illumination minimizes photo-damage while simultaneously enhancing contrast, optical sectioning and signal-to-noise ratio. Thus the imaging principle presented here merges the benefits of scanned light sheet microscopy and line-scanning confocal imaging.},

  ABSTRACT = {In fluorescence microscopy, the fluorescence emission can be characterised not only by intensity and position, but also by lifetime, polarization and wavelength. Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) can report on photophysical events that are difficult or impossible to observe by fluorescence intensity imaging, and time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy imaging (TR-FAIM) can measure the rotational mobility of a fluorophore in its environment. We compare different FLIM methods: a chief advantage of wide-field time-gating and phase modulation methods is the speed of acquisition whereas for time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) based confocal scanning it is accuracy in the fluorescence decay. FLIM has been used to image interactions between proteins such as receptor oligomerisation and to reveal protein phosphorylation by detecting fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). In addition, FLIM can also probe the local environment of fluorophores, reporting, for example, on the local pH, refractive index, ion or oxygen concentration without the need for ratiometric measurements.},

  ABSTRACT = {Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE) is a rapidly developing technology for quantitatively assessing the mechanical properties of tissue. The technology can be considered to be an imaging-based counterpart to palpation, commonly used by physicians to diagnose and characterize diseases. The success of palpation as a diagnostic method is based on the fact that the mechanical properties of tissues are often dramatically affected by the presence of disease processes such as cancer, inflammation, and fibrosis. MRE obtains information about the stiffness of tissue by assessing the propagation of mechanical waves through the tissue with a special magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique. The technique essentially involves three steps: generating shear waves in the tissue, acquiring MR images depicting the propagation of the induced shear waves and processing the images of the shear waves to generate quantitative maps of tissue stiffness, called elastograms. MRE is already being used clinically for the assessment of patients with chronic liver diseases and is emerging as a safe, reliable and noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy for staging hepatic fibrosis. MRE is also being investigated for application to pathologies of other organs including the brain, breast, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, lungs and skeletal muscle. The purpose of this review article is to introduce this technology to clinical anatomists and to summarize some of the current clinical applications that are being pursued.},

@ARTICLE{mclachlanExtremeFocalDepth1964,
  ABSTRACT = {This paper describes and gives some of the results of using a microscope which increases the useful depth of observation of an object in a photograph to many times the focal depth of the lens system being used. The principle of the microscope is that the object is illuminated only on the focal plane while the object is being scanned through that plane. Thus, the out-of-focus parts of the object are always in darkness, and the final photographs show high resolution throughout the depth of scan. The mechanism of scanning is somewhat similar to the Gregory?Donaldson method, whereas the mechanism of illumination is similar to that of the Schmaltz slit. This is the first time that scanning and focal plane illumination have been combined to attain high resolution at great depths. Of course, high-frequency scanning would permit direct observation by eye.},

@ARTICLE{ophirElastographyQuantitativeMethod1991,
  ABSTRACT = {We describe a new method for quantitative imaging of strain and elastic modulus distributions in soft tissues. The method is based on external tissue compression, with subsequent computation of the strain profile along the transducer axis, which is derived from cross-correlation analysis of pre- and post-compression A-line pairs. The strain profile can then be converted to an elastic modulus profile by measuring the stresses applied by the compressing device and applying certain corrections for the nonuniform stress field. We report initial results of several phantom and excised animal tissue experiments which demonstrate the ability of this technique to quantitatively image strain and elastic modulus distributions with good resolution, sensitivity and with diminished speckle. We discuss several potential clinical uses of this technique.},

@ARTICLE{reesBlindAssessmentLocalisation2012,
  ABSTRACT = {Abstract Background This paper analyses the resolution achieved in localisation microscopy experiments. The resolution is an essential metric for the correct interpretation of super-resolution images, but it varies between specimens due to different localisation precisions and densities. Methods By analysing localisation microscopy as a statistical method of Density Estimation, we present a method that produces a blind estimate of the resolution in a super-resolved image. This estimate is derived directly from the raw image data without the need for comparisons with known calibration specimens. It is corroborated with simulated and experimental data. Results and discussion Localisation microscopy has a resolution limit equal to 2σ, where σ is the r.m.s. localisation precision, evaluated as an average Thompson precision, Cramer Rao bound, or otherwise. Further, for a limited-sampling case in which there is only one localisation per fluorophore, the expected resolution of an optimised super-resolution image is worsened to approximately 3σ, due to smoothing processes that are necessarily involved in visualising the specimen with limited data. This 2σ or 3σ resolution can be estimated for any localisation microscopy specimen, and this metric can corroborate or replace empirical estimates of resolution. Other quantifiable resolution losses arise from sparse labelling, fluorescent label size, and motion blur.},

@ARTICLE{ritterCylindricalZoomLens2010,
  ABSTRACT = {Light sheet microscopy became a powerful tool in life sciences. Often, however, the sheet geometry is fixed, whereas it would be advantageous to adjust the sheet geometry to specimens of different dimensions. Therefore we developed an afocal cylindrical zoom lens system comprising only 5 lenses and a total system length of less than 160~mm. Two movable optical elements were directly coupled, so that the zoom factor could be adjusted from 1x to 6.3x by a single motor. Using two different illumination objectives we achieved a light sheet thickness ranging from 2.4~µm to 36~µm corresponding to lateral fields of 54~µm to 12.3~mm, respectively. Polytene chromosomes of salivary gland cell nuclei of C.tentans larvae were imaged in vivo to demonstrate the advantages in image contrast by imaging with different light sheet dimensions.},

We combined this method with light sheet microscopy for high contrast single particle imaging up to 200 µm deep within living tissue and real-time image analysis to determine 3D particle localizations with nanometer precision and millisecond temporal resolution. Axial information was instantly directed to the sample stage to keep a moving particle within the focal plane in an active feedback loop. We demonstrated 3D tracking of nanoparticles at an unprecedented depth throughout large cell nuclei over several thousand frames and a range of more than 10 µm in each spatial dimension, while simultaneously acquiring optically sectioned wide field images. We conclude that this 3D particle tracking technique employing light sheet microscopy presents a valuable extension to the nanoscopy toolbox.},

@THESIS{milneOpticalSortingManipulation2007,
  ABSTRACT = {Over the last few decades, the use of light to control and manipulate microscopic particles has become widespread. These methods are enabling new areas of research to flourish across the physical and biological sciences. This thesis describes investigations into both optical trapping and the closely related field of optical sorting. It documents the development of a variety of new techniques. The thesis begins with a short review of optical trapping and existing methods for sorting mixtures of microscopic particles. The first half of this chapter highlights some of the reasons behind optical trapping's rapid growth in popularity. By reviewing an array of methods for sorting particles and discussing the relative merits of each, the case for optical sorting is established. The second chapter describes research into using a spatial light modulator to create three-dimensional optically trapped colloidal structures using the time-sharing technique. Limiting factors inherent in the technology are discussed in detail. The third chapter reviews a sophisticated particle-tracking software package that has proved to be a considerable success. It was developed explicitly with colloidal microscopy in mind and experimental plots produced by the software are used throughout the thesis. Experimental studies have been performed into the behaviour of microscopic particles moving under the influence of two classes of propagation-invariant beams: Mathieu beams and Bessel beams. The Bessel beam studies have been complimented by a theoretical model and have led ultimately to a new method for the static optical sorting of both solid particles and biological cells, with particular emphasis on human blood. The fifth and final chapter describes how re-configurable optical devices can be implemented to spatially separate different colloidal species. A new method for creating arbitrary optical landscapes using an acousto-optic modulator is reported. This new technique is then used to optically sort four particle species simultaneously - the first experimental demonstration of polydisperse optical fractionation. Additionally, experiments are reported that demonstrate controlled, static optical sorting using a spatial light modulator.},

Performance was assessed using commonly defined measures. Although no single method performed best across all scenarios, the results revealed clear differences between the various approaches, leading to notable practical conclusions for users and developers.},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a computationally efficient, two-dimensional, feature point tracking algorithm for the automated detection and quantitative analysis of particle trajectories as recorded by video imaging in cell biology. The tracking process requires no a priori mathematical modeling of the motion, it is self-initializing, it discriminates spurious detections, and it can handle temporary occlusion as well as particle appearance and disappearance from the image region. The efficiency of the algorithm is validated on synthetic video data where it is compared to existing methods and its accuracy and precision are assessed for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios. The algorithm is well suited for video imaging in cell biology relying on low-intensity fluorescence microscopy. Its applicability is demonstrated in three case studies involving transport of low-density lipoproteins in endosomes, motion of fluorescently labeled Adenovirus-2 particles along microtubules, and tracking of quantum dots on the plasma membrane of live cells. The present automated tracking process enables the quantification of dispersive processes in cell biology using techniques such as moment scaling spectra. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Concurrently, light-sheet microscopy, also known as selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), has gained rapid favor with the imaging community in developmental biology due to its fast speed, high contrast, deep penetration, and low phototoxicity. While nearly a dozen reviews thoroughly describe the development of light-sheet microscopy and its technological breakthroughs with a main focus on improving the 3D imaging speed of fish embryos, central nervous system, and other tissues, few have addressed the potential of combining light-sheet microscopy and localization-based super-resolution imaging to achieve sub-diffraction-limited resolution. Adapting light-sheet illumination for single-molecule imaging presents unique challenges for instrumentation and reconstruction algorithms. In this Minireview, we provide an overview of the recent developments that address these challenges. We compare different approaches in super-resolution and light-sheet imaging, address advantages and limitations in each approach, and outline future directions of this emerging field.},

  ABSTRACT = {Resolution in optical nanoscopy (or super-resolution microscopy) depends on the localization uncertainty and density of single fluorescent labels and on the sample's spatial structure. Currently there is no integral, practical resolution measure that accounts for all factors. We introduce a measure based on Fourier ring correlation (FRC) that can be computed directly from an image. We demonstrate its validity and benefits on two-dimensional (2D) and 3D localization microscopy images of tubulin and actin filaments. Our FRC resolution method makes it possible to compare achieved resolutions in images taken with different nanoscopy methods, to optimize and rank different emitter localization and labeling strategies, to define a stopping criterion for data acquisition, to describe image anisotropy and heterogeneity, and even to estimate the average number of localizations per emitter. Our findings challenge the current focus on obtaining the best localization precision, showing instead how the best image resolution can be achieved as fast as possible.},

@ARTICLE{tsekenisSpatiallyResolvedObserverfree2015,
  ABSTRACT = {We present a novel framework and experimental method for the quantification of spatial resolution of a tomography system. The framework adopts the "black box" view of an imaging system, considering only its input and output. The tomography system is locally stimulated with a step input, viz., a sharp edge. The output, viz., the reconstructed images, is analysed by Fourier decomposition of their spatial frequency components, and the local limiting spatial resolution is determined using a cut-off threshold. At no point is an observer involved in the process. The framework also includes a means of translating the quantification region in the imaging space, thus creating a spatially resolved map of objectively quantified spatial resolution. As a case-study, the framework is experimentally applied using a gaseous propane phantom measured by a well-established chemical species tomography system. A spatial resolution map consisting of 28 regions is produced. In isolated regions, the indicated performance is 4-times better than that suggested in the literature and varies by 57\% across the imaging space. A mechanism based on adjacent but non-interacting beams is hypothesised to explain the observed behaviour. The mechanism suggests that, as also independently concluded by other methods, a geometrically regular beam array maintains maximum objectivity in reconstructions. We believe that the proposed framework, methodology, and findings will be of value in the design and performance evaluation of tomographic imaging arrays and systems.},

@ARTICLE{claxtonLaserScanningConfocal2006,
  ABSTRACT = {Laser scanning confocal microscopy has become an invaluable tool for a wide range of investigations in the biological and medical sciences for imaging thin optical sections in living and fixed specimens ranging in thickness up to 100 micrometers. Modern instruments are equipped with 3-5 laser systems controlled by high-speed acousto-optic tunable filters (AOTFs), which allow very precise regulation of wavelength and excitation intensity. Coupled with photomultipliers that have high quantum efficiency in the near-ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared spectral regions, these microscopes are capable of examining fluorescence emission ranging from 400 to 750 nanometers. Instruments equipped with spectral imaging detection systems further refine the technique by enabling the examination and resolution of fluorophores with overlapping spectra as well as providing the ability to compensate for autofluorescence. Recent advances in fluorophore design have led to improved synthetic and naturally occurring molecular probes, including fluorescent proteins and quantum dots, which exhibit a high level of photostability and target specificity.},

  ABSTRACT = {Light-sheet microscopy has recently emerged as the technique of choice for fast, high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) imaging of whole organisms, one that also features low photodamage1,2. Unlike confocal or multiphoton systems, light sheet– based microscopes can easily provide a combination of multiple views by rotating the sample. Multiview imaging solves the problems caused by light scattering, shadowing and anisotropy that are inherent to uniaxial optics. Sample rotation is also a fundamental aspect of optical tomography techniques3. However, image-acquisition and microscope-control software is not, by default, prepared to handle stage rotation. We present an open-source, fully customizable platform for the control of light-sheet microscopes and optical projection tomography (OPT) setups operating in different modes, based on Arduino and μManager4 hardware. Through our web page (http://uic.igc.gulbenkian.pt/micro-dslm.htm), we provide full access to hardware (sketches, a parts list and circuit designs) and software (plug-in code, μManager device adaptors and Arduino firmware).},

@ARTICLE{wuInvertedSelectivePlane2011a,
  ABSTRACT = {The Caenorhabditis elegans embryo is a powerful model for studying neural development, but conventional imaging methods are either too slow or phototoxic to take full advantage of this system. To solve these problems, we developed an inverted selective plane illumination microscopy (iSPIM) module for noninvasive high-speed volumetric imaging of living samples. iSPIM is designed as a straightforward add-on to an inverted microscope, permitting conventional mounting of specimens and facilitating SPIM use by development and neurobiology laboratories. iSPIM offers a volumetric imaging rate 30× faster than currently used technologies, such as spinning-disk confocal microscopy, at comparable signal-to-noise ratio. This increased imaging speed allows us to continuously monitor the development of C, elegans embryos, scanning volumes every 2 s for the 14-h period of embryogenesis with no detectable phototoxicity. Collecting ∼25,000 volumes over the entirety of embryogenesis enabled in toto visualization of positions and identities of cell nuclei. By merging two-color iSPIM with automated lineaging techniques we realized two goals: (i) identification of neurons expressing the transcription factor CEH-10/Chx10 and (ii) visualization of their neurodevelopmental dynamics. We found that canal-associated neurons use somal translocation and amoeboid movement as they migrate to their final position in the embryo. We also visualized axon guidance and growth cone dynamics as neurons circumnavigate the nerve ring and reach their targets in the embryo. The high-speed volumetric imaging rate of iSPIM effectively eliminates motion blur from embryo movement inside the egg case, allowing characterization of dynamic neurodevelopmental events that were previously inaccessible.},

  ABSTRACT = {Advances in the life sciences rely on the ability to observe dynamic processes in live systems and in environments that mimic in-vivo situations. Therefore, new methodological developments have to provide environments that resemble physiologically and clinically relevant conditions as closely as possible. In this work, plasma-induced laser nanosurgery for three-dimensional sample manipulation and sample perturbation is combined with optically sectioning light-sheet based fluorescence microscopy (SPIM) and applied to three-dimensional biological model systems. This means: a) working with a biological system that is not confined to essentially two dimensions like cell cultures on cover glasses, b) gaining intrinsic optical sectioning capabilities by an efficient three-dimensional fluorescence imaging system, and c) using arbitrarily-shaped three-dimensional ablation-patterns by a plasma-induced laser ablation system that prevent damage to surrounding tissues. Spatial levels in our biological applications range from sub-microns during delicate ablation of single microtubules over the confined disruption of cell membranes in an MDCK-cyst to the macroscopic cutting of a millimeter-sized Zebrafish caudal fin with arbitrary three-dimensional ablation patterns. Dynamic processes like laser-induced hemocyte migration can be studied with our SPIM-microscalpel in intact, live embryos.},

  ABSTRACT = {Although the highly dynamic and mosaic organization of the plasma membrane is well-recognized, depicting a resolved, global view of this organization remains challenging. We present an analytical single-particle tracking (SPT) method and tool, multiple-target tracing (MTT), that takes advantage of the high spatial resolution provided by single-fluorophore sensitivity. MTT can be used to generate dynamic maps at high densities of tracked particles, thereby providing global representation of molecular dynamics in cell membranes. Deflation by subtracting detected peaks allows detection of lower-intensity peaks. We exhaustively detected particles using MTT, with performance reaching theoretical limits, and then reconnected trajectories integrating the statistical information from past trajectories. We demonstrate the potential of this method by applying it to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) labeled with quantum dots (Qdots), in the plasma membrane of live cells. We anticipate the use of MTT to explore molecular dynamics and interactions at the cell membrane.},

  ABSTRACT = {A sharp point (5) is brought so close to the surface of a sample (4) to be investigated that the forces occurring between the atoms at the apex of the point (5) and those at the surface cause a spring-like cantilever (7) to deflect. The cantilever (7) forms one electrode of a tunneling microscope, the other electrode being a sharp tip (8). The deflection of the cantilever (7) provokes a variation of the tunnel current, and that variation is used to generate a correction signal which can be employed to control the distance between said point (5) and the sample (4), in order, for example, to maintain the force between them constant as the point (5) is scanned across the surface of the sample (4) by means of an xyz-drive (3). In certain modes of operation, either the sample (4) or the cantilever (7) may be excited to oscillate in z-direction. If the oscillation is at the resonance frequency of the cantilever (7), the resolution is enhanced},

In vivo imaging allows the study of both form and function in reasonably intact preparations, often with subcellular spatial resolution, a time resolution of milliseconds and a purview of months.

@ARTICLE{ahmedNanoscopyCellArchitecture2011a,
  ABSTRACT = {It was light microscopy that first revealed the hidden world of bacteria and the unit of life the “cell.” From these first observations, made in the late 1600s, it has been clear that seeing is an important tool in biology. The merging of the fields of fluorescence and microscopy created the possibility to see subcellular structures and proteins. In the 1990s the use of the confocal microscopes, where cells/tissue could be optically sectioned, further improved the resolution of object visualization. From this microworld view we now move forward to the exciting prospects of the nanoworld view of biology. In this review I propose a nanoimaging approach, nanoscopy, which could be used to reveal cell architecture at the level of proteins and protein complexes. Nanoscopy includes, the F-techniques, superresolution microscopy, correlative light and electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. To illustrate the biology that could be investigated by nanoscopy we focus on structures formed at the actin-membrane interface. In particular, focal adhesions and stress fibres have been analyzed using nanoscopy. Many of the proteins present in focal adhesions and stress fibres are shared with structures such as filopodia, lamellipodia, endocytic vesicles, actin pedestals and invadopodia. It is likely that nanoscopy of cells will reveal mechanistic details of biology at the level of individual proteins and protein complexes and importantly in a physiological context.},

  ABSTRACT = {We describe the development of multifunctional nanoparticle probes based on semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) for cancer targeting and imaging in living animals. The structural design involves encapsulating luminescent QDs with an ABC triblock copolymer and linking this amphiphilic polymer to tumor-targeting ligands and drug-delivery functionalities. In vivo targeting studies of human prostate cancer growing in nude mice indicate that the QD probes accumulate at tumors both by the enhanced permeability and retention of tumor sites and by antibody binding to cancer-specific cell surface biomarkers. Using both subcutaneous injection of QD-tagged cancer cells and systemic injection of multifunctional QD probes, we have achieved sensitive and multicolor fluorescence imaging of cancer cells under in vivo conditions. We have also integrated a whole-body macro-illumination system with wavelength-resolved spectral imaging for efficient background removal and precise delineation of weak spectral signatures. These results raise new possibilities for ultrasensitive and multiplexed imaging of molecular targets in vivo.},

  ABSTRACT = {Misfolding and aggregation of peptides and proteins is a characteristic of many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) aggregates to form characteristic fibrillar structures, which are the deposits found as plaques in the brains of patients. We have used direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy, dSTORM, to probe the process of in situ Abeta aggregation and the morphology of the ensuing aggregates with a resolution better than 20 nm. We are able to distinguish different types of structures, including oligomeric assemblies and mature fibrils, and observe a number of morphological differences between the species formed in vitro and in vivo, which may be significant in the context of disease. Our data support the recent view that intracellular Abeta could be associated with Abeta pathogenicity in AD, although the major deposits are extracellular, and suggest that this approach will be widely applicable to studies of the molecular mechanisms of protein deposition diseases.},

  ABSTRACT = {The nature of nervous system function and development is inherently global, since all components eventually influence one another. Networks communicate through dense synaptic, electric, and modulatory connections and develop through concurrent growth and interlinking of their neurons, processes, glia, and blood vessels. These factors drive the development of techniques capable of imaging neural signaling, anatomy, and developmental processes at ever-larger scales. Here, we discuss the nature of questions benefitting from large-scale imaging techniques and introduce recent applications. We focus on emerging light-sheet microscopy approaches, which are well suited for live imaging of large systems with high spatiotemporal resolution and over long periods of time. We also discuss computational methods suitable for extracting biological information from the resulting system-level image data sets. Together with new tools for reporting and manipulating neuronal activity and gene expression, these techniques promise new insights into the large-scale function and development of neural systems.},

  ABSTRACT = {Understanding the formation and propagation of aggregates of the Alzheimer disease-associated Tau protein in vivo is vital for the development of therapeutics for this devastating disorder. Using our recently developed live-cell aggregation sensor in neuron-like cells, we demonstrate that different variants of exogenous monomeric Tau, namely full-length Tau (hTau40) and the Tau-derived construct K18 comprising the repeat domain, initially accumulate in endosomal compartments, where they form fibrillar seeds that subsequently induce the aggregation of endogenous Tau. Using superresolution imaging, we confirm that fibrils consisting of endogenous and exogenous Tau are released from cells and demonstrate their potential to spread Tau pathology. Our data indicate a greater pathological risk and potential toxicity than hitherto suspected for extracellular soluble Tau.},

We developed digital scanned laser light sheet fluorescence microscopy and recorded nuclei localization and movement in entire wild-type and mutant zebrafish embryos over the first 24 hours of development. Multiview in vivo imaging at 1.5 billion voxels per minute provides “digital embryos,” that is, comprehensive databases of cell positions, divisions, and migratory tracks. Our analysis of global cell division patterns reveals a maternally defined initial morphodynamic symmetry break, which identifies the embryonic body axis. We further derive a model of germ layer formation and show that the mesendoderm forms from one-third of the embryo's cells in a single event. Our digital embryos, with 55 million nucleus entries, are provided as a resource.},

  ABSTRACT = {The capability to image single microbial cell surfaces at nanometer scale under native conditions would profoundly impact mechanistic and structural studies of pathogenesis, immunobiology, environmental resistance, and biotransformation. Here, using in vitro atomic force microscopy, we have directly visualized high-resolution native structures of bacterial endospores, including the exosporium and spore coats of four Bacillus species in air and water environments. Our results demonstrate that the mechanisms of spore coat self-assembly are similar to those described for inorganic and macromolecular crystallization. The dimensions of individual Bacillus atrophaeus spores decrease reversibly by 12\% in response to a change in the environment from fully hydrated to air-dried state, establishing that the dormant spore is a dynamic physical structure. The interspecies distributions of spore length and width were determined for four species of Bacillus spores in water and air environments. The dimensions of individual spores differ significantly depending upon species, growth regimes, and environmental conditions. These findings may be useful in the reconstruction of environmental and physiological conditions during spore formation and for modeling the inhalation and dispersal of spores. This study provides a direct insight into molecular architecture and structural variability of bacterial endospores as a function of spatial and developmental organizational scales.},

Although both amyloid-β and tau have been extensively studied individually with regard to their separate modes of toxicity, more recently new light has been shed on their possible interactions and synergistic effects in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we review novel findings that have shifted our understanding of the role of tau in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease towards being a crucial partner of amyloid-β. As we gain a deeper understanding of the different cellular functions of tau, the focus shifts from the axon, where tau has a principal role as a microtubule-associated protein, to the dendrite, where it mediates amyloid-β toxicity.},

  ABSTRACT = {Neurofibrillary tangles advance from layer II of the~entorhinal cortex (EC-II) toward limbic and association cortices as Alzheimer's disease evolves. However, the mechanism involved in this hierarchical pattern of disease progression is unknown. We describe a transgenic mouse model in which overexpression of human tau P301L is restricted to EC-II. Tau pathology progresses from EC transgene-expressing neurons to neurons without detectable transgene expression, first to EC neighboring cells, followed by propagation to neurons downstream in the synaptic circuit such as the dentate gyrus, CA fields of the hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Human tau protein spreads to these regions and coaggregates with endogenous mouse tau. With age, synaptic degeneration occurs in the entorhinal target zone and EC neurons are lost. These data suggest that a sequence of progressive misfolding of tau proteins, circuit-based transfer to new cell populations, and deafferentation induced degeneration are part of a process of tau-induced neurodegeneration.},

In this protocol we describe the whole-mount fixation and multimarker staining procedure, the tissue transparency treatment, microscopy and the analysis of resulting images. A typical two-color staining experiment can be performed and analyzed in approximately 6 d},

  ABSTRACT = {During gastrulation in the mouse embryo, dynamic cell movements including epiblast invagination and mesodermal layer expansion lead to the establishment of the three-layered body plan. The precise details of these movements, however, are sometimes elusive, because of the limitations in live imaging. To overcome this problem, we developed techniques to enable observation of living mouse embryos with digital scanned light sheet microscope (DSLM). The achieved deep and high time-resolution images of GFP-expressing nuclei and following 3D tracking analysis revealed the following findings: (i) Interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) occurs in the epiblast at embryonic day (E)6 and 6.5. (ii) INM-like migration occurs in the E5.5 embryo, when the epiblast is a monolayer and not yet pseudostratified. (iii) Primary driving force for INM at E6.5 is not pressure from neighboring nuclei. (iv) Mesodermal cells migrate not as a sheet but as individual cells without coordination.},

We describe a series of techniques needed to image the embryos under physiological conditions, including how to hold mouse embryos without agarose embedding, how to transfer embryos without air exposure and how to construct environmental chambers for live imaging by digital scanned light-sheet microscopy (DSLM). Computational tools include manual and semiautomatic tracking programs that are developed for analyzing the large 4D data sets acquired with this system. Note that this protocol does not include details of how to build the light-sheet microscope itself. Time-lapse imaging ends within 12 h, with subsequent tracking analysis requiring 3-6 d. Other than some mouse-handling skills, this protocol requires no advanced skills or knowledge. Light-sheet microscopes are becoming more widely available, and thus the techniques outlined in this paper should be helpful for investigating mouse embryogenesis.},

We have monitored the dynamics of mitochondrial distribution in hamster embryos at frequent intervals over 24 h using two-photon microscopy (1,047 nm) while maintaining blastocyst, and even fetal, developmental competence. In contrast, confocal imaging for only 8 h inhibits development, even without fluorophore excitation. Photo-induced production of H2O2 may account, in part, for this inhibition. Thus, two-photon microscopy, but not confocal microscopy, has permitted long-term fluorescence observations of the dynamics of three-dimensional cytoarchitecture in highly photosensitive specimens such as mammalian embryos.},

The advent of single molecule techniques over the past two decades has revolutionized the field of cell biology by providing a more quantitative picture of the complex and highly dynamic organization of living systems. Amongst these techniques, single particle tracking (SPT) has emerged as a powerful approach to study a variety of dynamic processes in life sciences. SPT provides access to single molecule behavior in the natural context of living cells, thereby allowing a complete statistical characterization of the system under study. In this review we describe the foundations of SPT together with novel optical implementations that nowadays allow the investigation of single molecule dynamic events with increasingly high spatiotemporal resolution using molecular densities closer to physiological expression levels. We outline some of the algorithms for the faithful reconstruction of SPT trajectories as well as data analysis, and highlight biological examples where the technique has provided novel insights into the role of diffusion regulating cellular function. The last part of the review concentrates on different theoretical models that describe anomalous transport behavior and ergodicity breaking observed from SPT studies in living cells.},

  ABSTRACT = {This study reports a general method of labeling enveloped viruses with semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) for use in single virus trafficking studies. Retroviruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), could be successfully tagged with QDs through the membrane incorporation of a short acceptor peptide (AP) that is susceptible to site-specific biotinylation and attachment of streptavidin-conjugated QDs. It was found that this AP tag-based QD labeling had little effect on the viral infectivity and allowed for the study of the kinetics of the internalization of the recombinant lentivirus enveloped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) into the early endosomes. It also allows for the live cell imaging of the trafficking of labeled virus to the Rab5(+) endosomal compartments. This study further demonstrated by direct visualization of QD-labeled virus that VSVG-pseudotyped lentivirus enters cells independent of clatherin- and caveolin-pathways, while the entry of VSVG-pseudotyped retrovirus occurs via the clathrin pathway. The studies monitoring HIV particles using QD-labeling showed that we could detect single virions on the surface of target cells expressing either CD4/CCR5 or DC-SIGN. Further internalization studies of QD-HIV evidently showed that the clathrin pathway is the major route for DC-SIGN-mediated uptake of viruses. Taken together, our data demonstrate the potential of this QD-labeling for visualizing the dynamic interactions between viruses and target cell structures.},

Owing to their optical, chemical and biofunctional properties, semiconductor quantum dot (QD) probes promise to be tools of choice in this endeavor. Here we review recent advances that allow ever more controlled experiments at the single-nanoparticle level in live cells. Several examples, related to membrane dynamics, cell signaling or intracellular transport, illustrate how single QD tracking can be readily used to decipher complex biological processes and address key concepts that underlie cellular organization and dynamics.},

@ARTICLE{baddeleyThreedimensionalSub100Nm2011,
  ABSTRACT = {Localisation microscopy overcomes the diffraction limit by measuring the position of individual molecules to obtain optical images with a lateral resolution better than 30 nm. Single molecule localisation microscopy was originally demonstrated only in two dimensions but has recently been extended to three dimensions. Here we develop a new approach to three-dimensional (3D) localisation microscopy by engineering of the point-spread function (PSF) of a fluorescence microscope. By introducing a linear phase gradient between the two halves of the objective pupil plane the PSF is split into two lateral lobes whose relative position depends on defocus. Calculations suggested that the phase gradient resulting from the very small tolerances in parallelism of conventional slides made from float glass would be sufficient to generate a two-lobed PSF. We demonstrate that insertion of a suitably chosen microscope slide that occupies half the objective aperture combined with a novel fast fitting algorithm for 3D localisation estimation allows nanoscopic imaging with detail resolution well below 100 nm in all three dimensions (standard deviations of 20, 16, and 42 nm in x, y, and z directions, respectively). The utility of the approach is shown by imaging the complex 3D distribution of microtubules in cardiac muscle cells that were stained with conventional near infrared fluorochromes. The straightforward optical setup, minimal hardware requirements and large axial localisation range make this approach suitable for many nanoscopic imaging applications.},

@ARTICLE{guanCompactPlaneIllumination2015a,
  ABSTRACT = {We developed a compact plane illumination plugin (PIP) device which enabled plane illumination and light sheet fluorescence imaging on a conventional inverted microscope. The PIP device allowed the integration of microscope with tunable laser sheet profile, fast image acquisition, and 3-D scanning. The device is both compact, measuring approximately 15 by 5 by 5 cm, and cost-effective, since we employed consumer electronics and an inexpensive device molding method. We demonstrated that PIP provided significant contrast and resolution enhancement to conventional microscopy through imaging different multi-cellular fluorescent structures, including 3-D branched cells in vitro and live zebrafish embryos. Imaging with the integration of PIP greatly reduced out-of-focus contamination and generated sharper contrast in acquired 2-D plane images when compared with the stand-alone inverted microscope. As a result, the dynamic fluid domain of the beating zebrafish heart was clearly segmented and the functional monitoring of the heart was achieved. Furthermore, the enhanced axial resolution established by thin plane illumination of PIP enabled the 3-D reconstruction of the branched cellular structures, which leads to the improvement on the functionality of the wide field microscopy.},

@ARTICLE{lorenzSingleHerpesvirusProtein2015a,
  ABSTRACT = {Herpesviruses assemble capsids in the nucleus and egress by unconventional vesicle-mediated trafficking through the nuclear envelope. Capsids bud at the inner nuclear membrane into the nuclear envelope lumen. The resulting intralumenal vesicles fuse with the outer nuclear membrane delivering the capsids to the cytoplasm. Two viral proteins are required for vesicle formation, the tail-anchored pUL34 and its soluble interactor pUL31. Whether cellular proteins are involved is unclear. Using giant unilamellar vesicles we show that pUL31 and pUL34 are sufficient for membrane budding and scission. pUL34 function can be by-passed by membrane-tethering of pUL31 demonstrating that pUL34 is required for pUL31 membrane recruitment but not for membrane remodelling. pUL31 can inwardly deform membranes by oligomerizing on their inner surface to form buds which constrict to vesicles. Thus a single viral protein can mediate all events necessary for membrane budding and abscission.},

@ARTICLE{fengTechniquesStudyingProtein2016a,
  ABSTRACT = {This review focuses on techniques that facilitate the visualization of protein trafficking. In the mid-1990's the cloning of GFP allowed fluorescently tagged proteins to be expressed in cells and then visualized in real time. This advance allowed a glimpse, for the first time, of the complex system within cells for distributing proteins. It quickly became apparent, however, that time-lapse sequences of exogenously expressed GFP-labeled proteins can be difficult to interpret. Reasons for this include the relatively low signal that comes from moving proteins and high background rates from stationary proteins and other sources, as well as the difficulty of identifying the origins and destinations of specific vesicular carriers. In this review we will examine a range of techniques that have overcome these issues to varying degrees and discuss the insights into protein trafficking that they have enabled. We will concentrate on neurons, as they are highly polarized and, thus, their trafficking systems tend to be accessible for study. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

However, the energy within the concentric side lobe structure of Bessel beams increases significantly with propagation length, generating unwanted out-of-focus fluorescence that enforces practical limits on the imaging field of view size. Here, we present a light sheet fluorescence microscope that achieves 390~nm isotropic resolution and high optical sectioning strength (i.e., out-of-focus blur is strongly suppressed) over large field of views, without the need for structured illumination or deconvolution-based postprocessing. We demonstrate simultaneous dual-color, high-contrast, and high-dynamic-range time-lapse imaging of migrating cells in complex three-dimensional microenvironments, three-dimensional tracking of clathrin-coated pits, and long-term imaging spanning {$>$}10~h and encompassing {$>$}2600 time points.},

  ABSTRACT = {The " Applications of Cell Biology in the Real World " Minisymposium comprised two full sessions. Although the topic was overwhelmingly broad, several central themes emerged. Disease mechanisms and therapeutics permeated many of the talks, with an array of different, and often unexpected, experimental systems, new analytical tools, and model organisms also discussed. Cancer was a focus of a number of presentations, with new approaches addressing long-standing problems. Lisa Belmont (Genentech) discussed strategies for targeting the tumor suppressor BRG1, an ATP-dependent helicase frequently mutated in cancer, which is part of the BAF complex that remodels chromatin. Based on synthetic lethal interaction identifications, the data she discussed suggest that inactivating related helicases might be a promising strategy. Bert Gough (University of Pittsburgh) described methods for exploiting (rather than bemoaning) the broad heterogeneity among different cell types to facilitate drug discovery, focusing on investigations of signaling heterogeneity in the IL-6-activated STAT3 pathway and describing novel tools such as a " heterogeneity browser. " Hirofumi Matsui (University of Tsukubu) discussed the de-velopment of optical cell separation and culture systems that use photodegradable hydrogels, photoirradiation, and cell picking to separate cells based on morphological criteria, along with the devel-opment of automated systems useful for the study of cancer cells. Another overarching theme encompassed cell death, aging, and neurodegeneration, with numerous new tools and approaches de-scribed here as well. Vlad Denic (Harvard University) described his studies of the essential protein heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) in yeast. Because Hsf1 inactivation causes protein aggregation, he used an " anchor-away " approach to acutely deplete Hsf1 in the presence of rapamycin and found that heat shock protein family members, in particular Hsp70 and Hsp90, were necessary and sufficient to allow cells to survive in the absence of Hsf1. Marc Hammarlund (Yale University) spoke about axon regeneration, using pulsed-laser axot-omy in Caenorhabditis elegans as an in vivo model and emphasizing the critical role of inhibiting poly(ADP-ribosylation) in stimulating regeneration. Jonny Nixon-Abell (University College London and National Institutes of Health) used emerging superresolution imag-ing approaches to clarify the distinct morphologies and dynamics of peripheral ER tubules and noted that important disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia are linked to proteins involved in ER morphology. Grazing incidence illumination (GI)-SIM and lattice light sheet-point accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography (LLS-PAINT) were used to reveal novel, ultrafast dynamism in the peripheral ER and further indicated that many structures classically considered peripheral sheets are instead dense tubular matrices. Christopher Medina (University of New Mexico) spoke about kine-sin-1 deficiency and imaging in living mouse brain, presenting tech-niques such as tracing circuitry in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging after focal manganese injection. These techniques were able to show altered axonal transport in vivo in hippocampal-to– basal forebrain memory circuits, pathogenically implicating de-creased synaptic vesicle replacement in active synapses. Moving to injury repair, Virginia Ayres (Michigan State University) identified nanoscale cues for regenerative neural cell systems, specifically for polyamide nanofiber scaffolds used in spinal cord injury repair, using specially adapted atomic force microscopy for the cues and super-resolution imaging for reactive astrocyte protein responses. A variety of neurodegenerative disorders also took center stage. Aditya Venkatesh (University of Massachusetts) spoke about retini-tis pigmentosa (RP), an inherited photoreceptor degenerative disor-der (with many known mutated genes in rod genes) that results in blindness from secondary loss of retinal cones. Cone survival de-pends on mTORC1, which has an essential role in clearance of au-tophagic aggregates. Activating mTORC1 by reducing TSC1 pro-motes long-term cone survival, prefiguring therapeutic potential to prolong vision in RP. Alzheimer's disease was the topic of several talks. Rylie Walsh (Brandeis University) investigated Drosophila neu-romuscular junctions to describe how perturbations in the retromer protein complex cause changes in amyloid precursor protein (APP)– positive exosome levels. Neuronal retromer was able to rescue APP accumulation in a retromer mutant. Natalya Gertsik (Weill Cornell Medical College) discussed how γ-secretase inhibitors and modula-tors might be useful for Alzheimer's disease treatment via their in-ducement of distinct conformational changes within the active sites of γ-secretase and signal peptide peptidase that she identified by photophore walking. Risa Broyer (University of California, San Diego) leveraged the cell biology of metabolic enzymes to uncover new insights into orphan genetic diseases affecting metabolic path-ways, emphasizing studies of PRPP synthase, where filament forma-tion may be involved in pathogenesis. Infections and vascular disorders are also prominent themes in medicine, and cell biology is enlightening these areas. Meron Mengistu (University of Maryland) spoke about HIV vaccine devel-opment, using three-dimensional dSTORM microscopic visualization},

@ARTICLE{beckerUltramicroscopyLightsheetbasedMicroscopy2013,
  ABSTRACT = {Ultramicroscopy (UM) is a powerful imaging technique that achieves precise and accurate three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions of intact macroscopic specimens with micrometer resolution. It was developed for specimens in the size range of ∼1-15 mm, such as whole mouse brains, mouse embryos, mouse organs, and Drosophila melanogaster. In UM, the specimen is illuminated perpendicular to the observation pathway by two thin counterpropagating sheets of laser light. UM is closely related to a growing family of comparable microscopy approaches based on light sheet illumination developed in recent years. This article presents an overview of light-sheet-based microscopy and describes the underlying physics of light sheet generation. The assembly of an "ultramicroscope" for investigating fixed chemically cleared tissue is described in detail, and the functions of the essential components, such as mechanics, camera, and objectives, are discussed. Finally, practical applications of UM for studying mouse organs, mouse embryos, and Drosophila adults are described.},

  ABSTRACT = {Light-sheet microscopy facilitates rapid, high-contrast, volumetric imaging with minimal sample exposure. However, the rapid divergence of a traditional Gaussian light sheet restricts the field of view (FOV) that provides innate subcellular resolution. We show that the Airy beam innately yields high contrast and resolution up to a tenfold larger FOV. In contrast to the Bessel beam, which also provides an increased FOV, the Airy beam's characteristic asymmetric excitation pattern results in all fluorescence contributing positively to the contrast, enabling a step change for light-sheet microscopy.},

@ARTICLE{yukToughBondingHydrogels2016,
  ABSTRACT = {In many animals, the bonding of tendon and cartilage to bone is extremely tough (for example, interfacial toughness \textasciitilde{}800 J m−2; refs 1,2), yet such tough interfaces have not been achieved between synthetic hydrogels and non-porous surfaces of engineered solids. Here, we report a strategy to design tough transparent and conductive bonding of synthetic hydrogels containing 90\% water to non-porous surfaces of diverse solids, including glass, silicon, ceramics, titanium and aluminium. The design strategy is to anchor the long-chain polymer networks of tough hydrogels covalently to non-porous solid surfaces, which can be achieved by the silanation of such surfaces. Compared with physical interactions, the chemical anchorage results in a higher intrinsic work of adhesion and in significant energy dissipation of bulk hydrogel during detachment, which lead to interfacial toughness values over 1,000 J m−2. We also demonstrate applications of robust hydrogel–solid hybrids, including hydrogel superglues, mechanically protective hydrogel coatings, hydrogel joints for robotic structures and robust hydrogel–metal conductors.},

  ABSTRACT = {The three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the cell nucleus plays an important role in protein dynamics and in regulating gene expression. However, protein dynamics within the 3D nucleus are poorly understood. Here, we present, to our knowledge, a novel combination of 1) single-objective based light-sheet microscopy, 2) photoconvertible proteins, and 3) fluorescence correlation microscopy, to quantitatively measure 3D protein dynamics in the nucleus. We are able to acquire \&gt;3400 autocorrelation functions at multiple spatial positions within a nucleus, without significant photobleaching, allowing us to make reliable estimates of diffusion dynamics. Using this tool, we demonstrate spatial heterogeneity in Polymerase II dynamics in live U2OS cells. Further, we provide detailed measurements of human-Yes-associated protein diffusion dynamics in a human gastric cancer epithelial cell line.},

@ARTICLE{royerAdaptiveLightsheetMicroscopy2016,
  ABSTRACT = {Optimal image quality in light-sheet microscopy requires a perfect overlap between the illuminating light sheet and the focal plane of the detection objective. However, mismatches between the light-sheet and detection planes are common owing to the spatiotemporally varying optical properties of living specimens. Here we present the AutoPilot framework, an automated method for spatiotemporally adaptive imaging that integrates (i) a multi-view light-sheet microscope capable of digitally translating and rotating light-sheet and detection planes in three dimensions and (ii) a computational method that continuously optimizes spatial resolution across the specimen volume in real time. We demonstrate long-term adaptive imaging of entire developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) and Drosophila melanogaster embryos and perform adaptive whole-brain functional imaging in larval zebrafish. Our method improves spatial resolution and signal strength two to five-fold, recovers cellular and sub-cellular structures in many regions that are not resolved by non-adaptive imaging, adapts to spatiotemporal dynamics of genetically encoded fluorescent markers and robustly optimizes imaging performance during large-scale morphogenetic changes in living organisms.},

Image registration is the process of overlaying images (two or more) of the same scene taken at different times, from different viewpoints, and/or by different sensors. The registration geometrically align two images (the reference and sensed images). The reviewed approaches are classified according to their nature (area-based and feature-based) and according to four basic steps of image registration procedure: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Main contributions, advantages, and drawbacks of the methods are mentioned in the paper. Problematic issues of image registration and outlook for the future research are discussed too. The major goal of the paper is to provide a comprehensive reference source for the researchers involved in image registration, regardless of particular application areas.},

@ARTICLE{bradyMultiscaleGigapixelPhotography2012,
  ABSTRACT = {Pixel count is the ratio of the solid angle within a camera/'s field of view to the solid angle covered by a single detector element. Because the size of the smallest resolvable pixel is proportional to aperture diameter and the maximum field of view is scale independent, the diffraction-limited pixel count is proportional to aperture area. At present, digital cameras operate near the fundamental limit of 1-10\,megapixels for millimetre-scale apertures, but few approach the corresponding limits of 1-100\,gigapixels for centimetre-scale apertures. Barriers to high-pixel-count imaging include scale-dependent geometric aberrations, the cost and complexity of gigapixel sensor arrays, and the computational and communications challenge of gigapixel image management. Here we describe the AWARE-2 camera, which uses a 16-mm entrance aperture to capture snapshot, one-gigapixel images at three frames per minute. AWARE-2 uses a parallel array of microcameras to reduce the problems of gigapixel imaging to those of megapixel imaging, which are more tractable. In cameras of conventional design, lens speed and field of view decrease as lens scale increases, but with the experimental system described here we confirm previous theoretical results suggesting that lens speed and field of view can be scale independent in microcamera-based imagers resolving up to 50 gigapixels. Ubiquitous gigapixel cameras may transform the central challenge of photography from the question of where to point the camera to that of how to mine the data.},

  ABSTRACT = {Abstract.~ We have developed a light-sheet microscope that uses confocal scanning of dual-Bessel beams for illumination. A digital micromirror device (DMD) is placed in the intermediate image plane of the objective used to collect fluorescence and is programmed with two lines of pixels in the “on” state such that the DMD functions as a spatial filter to reject the out-of-focus background generated by the side-lobes of the Bessel beams. The optical sectioning and out-of-focus background rejection capabilities of this microscope were demonstrated by imaging of fluorescently stained actin in human A431 cells. The dual-Bessel beam system enables twice as many photons to be detected per imaging scan, which is useful for low light applications (e.g., single-molecule localization) or imaging at high speed with a superior signal to noise. While demonstrated for two Bessel beams, this approach is scalable to a larger number of beams.},

The radiated component of the electric field is also evaluated, displaying unique features of the nonparaxial Bessel pincers light-sheets. This new type of light-sheets finds potential applications in the development of novel methods in optical light-sheet tweezers for particle manipulation in opto-fluidics, particle sizing and imaging. Numerical predictions for the scattering, radiation force and torque, and particle dynamics also benefit from the developed beam solution.},

@ARTICLE{zhanghaoSuperresolutionDipoleOrientation2016,
  ABSTRACT = {Fluorescence polarization microscopy (FPM) aims to detect the dipole orientation of fluorophores and to resolve structural information for labeled organelles via wide-field or confocal microscopy. Conventional FPM often suffers from the presence of a large number of molecules within the diffraction-limited volume, with averaged fluorescence polarization collected from a group of dipoles with different orientations. Here, we apply sparse deconvolution and least-squares estimation to fluorescence polarization modulation data and demonstrate a super-resolution dipole orientation mapping (SDOM) method that resolves the effective dipole orientation from a much smaller number of fluorescent molecules within a sub-diffraction focal area. We further apply this method to resolve structural details in both fixed and live cells. For the first time, we show that different borders of a dendritic spine neck exhibit a heterogeneous distribution of dipole orientation. Furthermore, we illustrate that the dipole is always perpendicular to the direction of actin filaments in mammalian kidney cells and radially distributed in the hourglass structure of the septin protein under specific labelling. The accuracy of the dipole orientation can be further mapped using the orientation uniform factor, which shows the superiority of SDOM compared with its wide-field counterpart as the number of molecules is decreased within the smaller focal area. Using the inherent feature of the orientation dipole, the SDOM technique, with its fast imaging speed (at sub-second scale), can be applied to a broad range of fluorescently labeled biological systems to simultaneously resolve the valuable dipole orientation information with super-resolution imaging.},

  ABSTRACT = {Particle tracking is a powerful microscopy technique to quantify the motion of individual particles at high spatial and temporal resolution in complex fluids and biological specimens. Particle tracking's applications and impact in drug and gene delivery research have greatly increased during the last decade. Thanks to advances in hardware and software, this technique is now more accessible than ever, and can be reliably automated to enable rapid processing of large data sets, thereby further enhancing the role that particle tracking will play in drug and gene delivery studies in the future. We begin this review by discussing particle tracking-based advances in characterizing extracellular and cellular barriers to therapeutic nanoparticles and in characterizing nanoparticle size and stability. To facilitate wider adoption of the technique, we then present a user-friendly review of state-of-the-art automated particle tracking algorithms and methods of analysis. We conclude by reviewing technological developments for next-generation particle tracking methods, and we survey future research directions in drug and gene delivery where particle tracking may be useful.},

@ARTICLE{diniIdentifyingNecroticZone2016a,
  ABSTRACT = {Automatic identification of the necrotic zone boundary is important in the assessment of treatments on in vitro tumour spheroids. This has been difficult especially when the difference in cell density between the necrotic and viable zones of a tumour spheroid is small. To help overcome this problem, we developed novel one-dimensional pair-correlation functions (PCFs) to provide quantitative estimates of the radial distance of the necrotic zone boundary from the centre of a tumour spheroid. We validate our approach on synthetic tumour spheroids in which the position of the necrotic zone boundary is known a priori. It is then applied to nine real tumour spheroids imaged with light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy. PCF estimates of the necrotic zone boundary are compared with those of a human expert and an existing standard computational method.},

@ARTICLE{kumar_using_2016,
  ABSTRACT = {Dual-view inverted selective plane illumination microscopy (diSPIM) enables high-speed, long-term, four-dimensional (4D) imaging with isotropic spatial resolution. It is also compatible with conventional sample mounting on glass coverslips. However, broadening of the light sheet at distances far from the beam waist and sample-induced scattering degrades diSPIM contrast and optical sectioning. We describe two simple improvements that address both issues and entail no additional hardware modifications to the base diSPIM. First, we demonstrate improved diSPIM sectioning by keeping the light sheet and detection optics stationary, and scanning the sample through the stationary light sheet (rather than scanning the broadening light sheet and detection plane through the stationary sample, as in conventional diSPIM). This stage-scanning approach allows a thinner sheet to be used when imaging laterally extended samples, such as fixed microtubules or motile mitochondria in cell monolayers, and produces finer contrast than does conventional diSPIM. We also used stage-scanning diSPIM to obtain high-quality, 4D nuclear datasets derived from an uncompressed nematode embryo, and performed lineaging analysis to track 97\% of cells until twitching. Second, we describe the improvement of contrast in thick, scattering specimens by synchronizing light-sheet synthesis with the rolling, electronic shutter of our scientific complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (sCMOS) detector. This maneuver forms a virtual confocal slit in the detection path, partially removing out-of-focus light. We demonstrate the applicability of our combined stage- and slit-scanning- methods by imaging pollen grains and nuclear and neuronal structures in live nematode embryos. All acquisition and analysis code is freely available online.},

  ABSTRACT = {In light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), only the focal plane is illuminated by a laser light sheet. Hence, only the fluorophores within a thin volume of the specimen are excited. This reduces photo-bleaching and photo-toxic effects by several orders of magnitude compared with any other form of microscopy. Therefore, LSFM (aka single/selective-plane illumination microscopy [SPIM] or digitally scanned light sheet microscopy [DSLM]) is the technique of choice for the three-dimensional imaging of live or fixed and of small or large three-dimensional specimens. The parallel recording of millions of pixels with modern cameras provides an extremely fast acquisition speed. Recent developments address the penetration depth, the resolution and the recording speed of LSFM. The impact of LSFM on research areas such as three-dimensional cell cultures, neurosciences, plant biology and developmental biology is increasing at a rapid pace. The development of high-throughput LSFM is the next leap forward, allowing the application of LSFM in toxicology and drug discovery screening.},

@ARTICLE{aguet_membrane_2016,
  ABSTRACT = {Membrane remodeling is an essential part for transfer of components to and from the cell surface and membrane-bound organelles, and for changes in cell shape, particularly critical during cell division. Earlier analyses, based on classical optical live-cell imaging, mostly restricted by technical necessity to the attached bottom surface, showed persistent formation of endocytic clathrin pits and vesicles during mitosis. Taking advantage of the resolution, speed, and non-invasive illumination of the newly developed lattice light sheet fluorescence microscope, we reexamined their assembly dynamics over the entire cell surface and showed that clathrin pits form at a lower rate during late mitosis. Full-cell imaging measurements of cell surface area and volume throughout the cell cycle of single cells in culture and in zebrafish embryos showed that the total surface increased rapidly during the transition from telophase to cytokinesis, whereas cell volume increased slightly in metaphase and remained relatively constant during cytokinesis. These applications demonstrate the advantage of lattice light sheet microscopy and enable a new standard for imaging membrane dynamics in single cells and in multicellular assemblies.},

  ABSTRACT = {Light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy became an important tool in developmental biology due to its high acquisition speed, low photo-bleaching rate and the high survival probability of the specimens. Initially applied to document the embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster, it is now used to investigate the embryonic morphogenesis of emerging model organisms such as the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. Here, we discuss the principles of light sheet-based fluorescence microscopy and outline Tribolium as a model organism for developmental biology. We summarize labeling options and present two custom-built transgenic lines suitable for live imaging. Finally, we highlight studies on Tribolium that address scientific questions with fluorescence live imaging and discuss the comparative approach to investigate insect morphogenesis in an evolutionary context.},

  ABSTRACT = {Science outreach and communication are gaining more and more importance for conveying the meaning of today’s research to the general public. Public exhibitions of scientific instruments can provide hands-on experience with technical advances and their applications in the life sciences. The software of such devices, however, is oftentimes not appropriate for this purpose. In this study, we describe a software framework and the necessary computer configuration that is well suited for exposing a complex self-built and software-controlled instrument such as a microscope to laymen under limited supervision, e.g. in museums or schools. We identify several aspects that must be met by such software, and we describe a design that can simultaneously be used to control either (i) a fully functional instrument in a robust and fail-safe manner, (ii) an instrument that has low-cost or only partially working hardware attached for illustration purposes or (iii) a completely virtual instrument without hardware attached. We describe how to assess the educational success of such a device, how to monitor its operation and how to facilitate its maintenance. The introduced concepts are illustrated using our software to control eduSPIM, a fluorescent light sheet microscope that we are currently exhibiting in a technical museum.},

  ABSTRACT = {Summary Amyloidosis is a major problem in over one hundred diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using the iDISCO visualization method involving targeted molecular labeling, tissue clearing, and light-sheet microscopy, we studied plaque formation in the intact AD mouse brain at up to 27~months of age. We visualized amyloid plaques in 3D together with tau, microglia, and vasculature. Volume imaging coupled to automated detection and mapping enables precise and fast quantification of plaques within the entire intact mouse brain. The present methodology is also applicable to analysis of frozen human brain samples without specialized preservation. Remarkably, amyloid plaques in human brain tissues showed greater 3D complexity and surprisingly large three-dimensional amyloid patterns, or TAPs. The ability to visualize amyloid in 3D, especially in the context of their micro-environment, and the discovery of large TAPs may have important scientific and medical implications.},

  ABSTRACT = {Despite significant progress, high-speed live-cell super-resolution studies remain limited to specialized optical setups, generally requiring intense phototoxic illumination. Here, we describe a new analytical approach, super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF), provided as a fast graphics processing unit-enabled ImageJ plugin. In the most challenging data sets for super-resolution, such as those obtained in low-illumination live-cell imaging with GFP, we show that SRRF is generally capable of achieving resolutions better than 150 nm. Meanwhile, for data sets similar to those obtained in PALM or STORM imaging, SRRF achieves resolutions approaching those of standard single-molecule localization analysis. The broad applicability of SRRF and its performance at low signal-to-noise ratios allows super-resolution using modern widefield, confocal or TIRF microscopes with illumination orders of magnitude lower than methods such as PALM, STORM or STED. We demonstrate this by super-resolution live-cell imaging over timescales ranging from minutes to hours.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in far-field fluorescence microscopy have led to substantial improvements in image resolution, achieving a near-molecular resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the two lateral dimensions. Three-dimensional (3D) nanoscale-resolution imaging, however, remains a challenge. We demonstrated 3D stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) by using optical astigmatism to determine both axial and lateral positions of individual fluorophores with nanometer accuracy. Iterative, stochastic activation of photoswitchable probes enables high-precision 3D localization of each probe, and thus the construction of a 3D image, without scanning the sample. Using this approach, we achieved an image resolution of 20 to 30 nanometers in the lateral dimensions and 50 to 60 nanometers in the axial dimension. This development allowed us to resolve the 3D morphology of nanoscopic cellular structures. Three-dimensional fluorescence images of cellular structures in fixed cells are realized at 20- to 30-nanometer lateral and 50-nanometer axial resolution, without scanning. Three-dimensional fluorescence images of cellular structures in fixed cells are realized at 20- to 30-nanometer lateral and 50-nanometer axial resolution, without scanning.},

  ABSTRACT = {We demonstrate the first, to our knowledge, integration of stimulated emission depletion (STED) with selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM). Using this method, we were able to obtain up to 60\% improvements in axial resolution with lateral resolution enhancements in control samples and zebrafish embryos. The integrated STED-SPIM method combines the advantages of SPIM with the resolution enhancement of STED, and thus provides a method for fast, high-resolution imaging with \&gt;100 μm deep penetration into biological tissue.},

@ARTICLE{planchonRapidThreedimensionalIsotropic2011,
  ABSTRACT = {A key challenge when imaging living cells is how to noninvasively extract the most spatiotemporal information possible. Unlike popular wide-field and confocal methods, plane-illumination microscopy limits excitation to the information-rich vicinity of the focal plane, providing effective optical sectioning and high speed while minimizing out-of-focus background and premature photobleaching. Here we used scanned Bessel beams in conjunction with structured illumination and/or two-photon excitation to create thinner light sheets ({$<$}0.5 μm) better suited to three-dimensional (3D) subcellular imaging. As demonstrated by imaging the dynamics of mitochondria, filopodia, membrane ruffles, intracellular vesicles and mitotic chromosomes in live cells, the microscope currently offers 3D isotropic resolution down to \textasciitilde{}0.3 μm, speeds up to nearly 200 image planes per second and the ability to noninvasively acquire hundreds of 3D data volumes from single living cells encompassing tens of thousands of image frames.},

  ABSTRACT = {Visualizing protein dynamics is the key to a quantitative understanding of molecular mechanisms in biological systems. Recent developments in fluorescent microscopy techniques allow for novel experimental approaches to study stochastic localization, distribution and movement of fluorescently labeled molecules in high resolution as they occur over time in the context of living cells and whole organisms. Particularly suitable for such studies is the application of light sheet microscopy, as it enables rapid in vivo imaging of a wide range and size of specimen, from whole organisms and organs, down to the dynamics of subcellular structures and single molecules. This article summarizes the principles of light sheet microscopy and its advantages over other optical imaging techniques, such as light microscopy and confocal microscopy, and highlights recent innovations that significantly enhance spatio-temporal resolution. Also, this manuscript contains basic guidelines for the implementation of light sheet microscopy in the laboratory and presents thus far unpublished light sheet microscopy applications demonstrating the ability of this technology to measure protein dynamics in a whole-organism context.

  ABSTRACT = {Large, living biological specimens present challenges to existing optical imaging techniques because of their absorptive and scattering properties. We developed selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) to generate multidimensional images of samples up to a few millimeters in size. The system combines two-dimensional illumination with orthogonal camera-based detection to achieve high-resolution, optically sectioned imaging throughout the sample, with minimal photodamage and at speeds capable of capturing transient biological phenomena. We used SPIM to visualize all muscles in vivo in the transgenic Medaka line Arnie, which expresses green fluorescent protein in muscle tissue. We also demonstrate that SPIM can be applied to visualize the embryogenesis of the relatively opaque Drosophila melanogaster in vivo. Excitation of fluorescent molecules with a single plane of light allows collection of three-dimensional images rapidly enough to visualize a heart beating within a fish embryo. Excitation of fluorescent molecules with a single plane of light allows collection of three-dimensional images rapidly enough to visualize a heart beating within a fish embryo.},

For a full understanding of the organism's structure and function, it is mandatory to obtain data from the whole animal, not just parts of it. In this paper, we present our work with the Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM) for imaging a Nissl-stained whole zebrafish larva. KESM combines a diamond microtome and line-scan imaging for simultaneous sectioning and imaging in 3D. We show that using the KESM, a zebrafish, less than 3 mm long and diameter less than 500 μm, can be imaged within 1 hour at a resolution of 0.6 μm × 0.7 μm × 1.0 μm. We also present new results on using a vibrating microtome to improve sectioning and imaging robustness.},

  ABSTRACT = {In 3D, diffraction-free or Bessel beams are well known and have found applications in diverse fields. An analog in 2D, or pseudonondiffracting (PND) beams, is a nontrivial problem, and existing methods suffer from deficiencies. For example, Airy beams are not highly localized, some PND beams have significant side lobes, and a cosine beam has to be truncated by a very narrow aperture thus discarding most of the energy. We show, both theoretically and experimentally, that it is possible to generate a quasi-nondiffracting 2D light beam in a simple and efficient fashion. This is achieved by placing a mask consisting of a pair of double slits on a cylindrical lens. The applications include light sheet microscopy/optical sectioning and particle manipulation.},

  ABSTRACT = {Single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) is a new optical method that has become extremely important in recent years. It is based on the formation of a “light slice” in the specimen in which fluorescently tagged molecules are observed. The spatial resolution is close to that of confocal optics, but without the disadvantages inherent to scanning or high laser irradiation doses. A recent development is light sheet fluctuation microscopy, which exploits the dynamic information contained in the fluorescence intensity fluctuations of each image pixel. Here we review the principles of this method and show some recent applications to the dynamics of transcription factors and chromatin. We show that the dimerization of Fos and Jun proteins is directly linked to their binding to DNA; that nuclear receptor activation changes their intranuclear dynamics; and that the viscoelastic behavior of interphase chromatin strongly depends on the presence of lamin A.},

  ABSTRACT = {Scattering and absorption limit the penetration of optical fields into tissue, but wavefront correction, often used to compensate for these effects, is incompatible with wide field-of-view imaging and complex to implement. We demonstrate a new approach for increased penetration in light-sheet imaging, namely attenuation-compensation of the light field. This tailors an exponential intensity increase along the illuminating propagation-invariant field, enabling the redistribution of intensity strategically within a sample. This powerful yet straightforward concept, combined with the self-healing of the propagation-invariant field, improves the signal-to-background ratio of Airy light-sheet microscopy up to five-fold and the contrast-to-noise ratio up to eight-fold in thick biological specimens across the field-of-view without any aberration-correction. This improvement is not limited to Airy beam light-sheet microscopy, but can also significantly increase the imaging capabilities of Bessel and lattice light-sheet microscopy techniques, paving the way for widespread uptake by the biomedical community.},

  ABSTRACT = {The fluorescent protein revolution has made the light microscope the most widely used tool for studying biological structure from the single-molecule to whole organism scales. However, traditional approaches are limited in their ability to resolve components in highly complex structures, such as the brain. In recent years, this limitation has been circumvented by the development of multicolor labeling methods, termed Brainbow. Brainbow tools rely on site-specific recombinases to make stochastic “choices” between different combinations of fluorescent proteins so that structures in close proximity to one another can be resolved based on their color profile. These new approaches, however, call for more refined methods of sample preparation and imaging optimized for multispectral imaging, which are presented here. The most robust approach for generating useful Brainbow data combines immunohistology with multispectral laser scanning confocal microscopy. This chapter, therefore, focuses on this particular technique, though the imaging principle discussed here is applicable to other Brainbow approaches as well.},

@ARTICLE{packardAutomatedSegmentationLightSheet2017,
  ABSTRACT = {This study sought to develop an automated segmentation approach based on histogram analysis of raw axial images acquired by light-sheet fluorescent imaging (LSFI) to establish rapid reconstruction of the 3-D zebrafish cardiac architecture in response to doxorubicin-induced injury and repair. Input images underwent a 4-step automated image segmentation process consisting of stationary noise removal, histogram equalization, adaptive thresholding, and image fusion followed by 3-D reconstruction. We applied this method to 3-month old zebrafish injected intraperitoneally with doxorubicin followed by LSFI at 3, 30, and 60 days post-injection. We observed an initial decrease in myocardial and endocardial cavity volumes at day 3, followed by ventricular remodeling at day 30, and recovery at day 60 (P\,{$<$}\,0.05, n\,=\,7–19). Doxorubicin-injected fish developed ventricular diastolic dysfunction and worsening global cardiac function evidenced by elevated E/A ratios and myocardial performance indexes quantified by pulsed-wave Doppler ultrasound at day 30, followed by normalization at day 60 (P\,{$<$}\,0.05, n\,=\,9–20). Treatment with the γ-secretase inhibitor, DAPT, to inhibit cleavage and release of Notch Intracellular Domain (NICD) blocked cardiac architectural regeneration and restoration of ventricular function at day 60 (P\,{$<$}\,0.05, n\,=\,6–14). Our approach provides a high-throughput model with translational implications for drug discovery and genetic modifiers of chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathy.},

Our results show clearly that, a high-order three-Airy beam tends to evolve into a Laguerre-Gaussian-like beam, in consistence with previous prediction. Moreover, by analyzing the internal transverse power flow of three-Airy beams during propagation, we found that, as the order of three-Airy beams goes higher, the initial beam intensity distributes more in the “side lobes”, and it takes longer propagation for the beams to reach a maximum peak intensity and then transform into patterns of corresponding Laguerre-Gaussian-like modes.},

@ARTICLE{duchiNewHolistic3D2017,
  ABSTRACT = {Cell interaction with biomaterials is one of the keystones to developing medical devices for tissue engineering applications. Biomaterials are the scaffolds that give three-dimensional support to the cells, and are vectors that deliver the cells to the injured tissue requiring repair. Features of biomaterials can influence the behaviour of the cells and consequently the efficacy of the tissue-engineered product. The adhesion, distribution and motility of the seeded cells onto the scaffold represent key aspects, and must be evaluated in vitro during the product development, especially when the efficacy of a specific tissue-engineered product depends on viable and functional cell loading. In this work, we propose a non-invasive and non-destructive imaging analysis for investigating motility, viability and distribution of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) on silk fibroin-based alginate microcarriers, to test the adhesion capacity of the fibroin coating onto alginate which is known to be unsuitable for cell adhesion. However, in depth characterization of the biomaterial is beyond the scope of this paper. Scaffold-loaded MSCs were stained with Calcein-AM and Ethidium homodimer-1 to detect live and dead cells, respectively, and counterstained with Hoechst to label cell nuclei. Time-lapse Light Sheet Fluorescent Microscopy (LSFM) was then used to produce three-dimensional images of the entire cells-loaded fibroin/alginate microcarriers. In order to quantitatively track the cell motility over time, we also developed an open source user friendly software tool called Fluorescent Cell Tracker in Three-Dimensions (F-Tracker3D). Combining LSFM with F-Tracker3D we were able for the first time to assess the distribution and motility of stem cells in a non-invasive, non-destructive, quantitative, and three-dimensional analysis of the entire surface of the cell-loaded scaffold. We therefore propose this imaging technique as an innovative holistic tool for monitoring cell-biomaterial interactions, and as a tool for the design, fabrication and functionalization of a scaffold as a medical device.},

@ARTICLE{changSynchronizationfreeLightSheet2017,
  ABSTRACT = {High-speed 3D microscopic imaging methods have led to numerous biological discoveries. In this Letter, we present a sync-free light sheet microscope (LSM) based on a static phase mask that eliminates the need for coupling the detection plane, thereby enabling high-speed volumetric imaging that is only limited by the speed of cameras, e.g., ∼1000 cross sections/s. In the sync-free design, the emission signals are first guided to the back of a galvanometric mirror, which laterally scans the emissions across a 2D phase mask, converting it to axial scanning that automatically compensates the focal shifts in the detection optics. Parametric models are developed to guide the phase mask design as well as to relate the axial scanning depth and magnification to design parameters. To quickly evaluate the different mask designs, a liquid-crystal-based spatial light modulator (LC-SLM) is used in the system. In the experiments, we scanned pollen and tissue samples via both the 2D phase mask and a piezoelectric objective scanner. The results show that the new method can generate clear images with comparable quality throughout the scanning range. The overall efficiency of the LSM is ∼10\%. It is worthwhile to note that the efficiency will be significantly improved by replacing the LC-SLM with a custom-made lens. The new method realizes a compact LSM for high-speed 3D imaging that may find important applications in in vivo biological imaging.},

@INPROCEEDINGS{reidtGaussianVsBessel2017,
  ABSTRACT = {Lightsheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has rapidly progressed in the past decade from an emerging technology into an established methodology. This progress has largely been driven by its suitability to developmental biology, where it is able to give excellent spatial-temporal resolution over relatively large fields of view with good contrast and low phototoxicity. In many respects it is superseding confocal microscopy. However, it is no magic bullet and still struggles to image deeply in more highly scattering samples. Many solutions to this challenge have been presented, including, Airy and Bessel illumination, 2-photon operation and deconvolution techniques. In this work, we show a comparison between a simple but effective Gaussian beam illumination and Bessel illumination for imaging in chicken embryos. Whilst Bessel illumination is shown to be of benefit when a greater depth of field is required, it is not possible to see any benefits for imaging into the highly scattering tissue of the chick embryo.},

  ABSTRACT = {The dynamic reshaping of tissues during morphogenesis results from a combination of individual cell behaviors and collective cell rearrangements. However, a comprehensive framework to unambiguously measure and link cell behavior to tissue morphogenesis is lacking. Here we introduce such a kinematic framework, bridging cell and tissue behaviors at an intermediate, mesoscopic, level of cell clusters or domains. By measuring domain deformation in terms of the relative motion of cell positions and the evolution of their shapes, we characterized the basic invariant quantities that measure fundamental classes of cell behavior, namely tensorial rates of cell shape change and cell intercalation. In doing so we introduce an explicit definition of cell intercalation as a continuous process. We mapped strain rates spatiotemporally in three models of tissue morphogenesis, gaining insight into morphogenetic mechanisms. Our quantitative approach has broad relevance for the precise characterization and comparison of morphogenetic phenotypes.},

  ABSTRACT = {We introduce a concept that enables parallelized three-dimensional imaging throughout large volumes with isotropic 300–350\,nm resolution. By staggering high aspect ratio illumination beams laterally and axially within the depth of focus of a digitally scanned light-sheet fluorescence microscope (LSFM), multiple image planes can be simultaneously imaged with minimal cross-talk and light loss. We present a first demonstration of this concept for parallelized imaging by synthesizing two light-sheets with nonlinear Bessel beams and perform volumetric imaging of fluorescent beads and invasive breast cancer cells. This work demonstrates that in principle any digitally scanned LSFM can be parallelized in a lossless manner, enabling drastically faster volumetric image acquisition rates for a given sample brightness and detector technology.},

@ARTICLE{ahmedActiveCellMechanics2015,
  ABSTRACT = {Living cells are active mechanical systems that are able to generate forces. Their structure and shape are primarily determined by biopolymer filaments and molecular motors that form the cytoskeleton. Active force generation requires constant consumption of energy to maintain the nonequilibrium activity to drive organization and transport processes necessary for their function. To understand this activity it is necessary to develop new approaches to probe the underlying physical processes. Active cell mechanics incorporates active molecular-scale force generation into the traditional framework of mechanics of materials. This review highlights recent experimental and theoretical developments towards understanding active cell mechanics. We focus primarily on intracellular mechanical measurements and theoretical advances utilizing the Langevin framework. These developing approaches allow a quantitative understanding of nonequilibrium mechanical activity in living cells. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Mechanobiology.},

  ABSTRACT = {Cell movements are coordinated across spatio-temporal scales to achieve precise positioning of organs during vertebrate gastrulation. In zebrafish, mechanisms governing such morphogenetic movements have so far only been studied within a local region or a single germlayer. Here, we present pan-embryo analyses of fate specification and dynamics of all three germlayers simultaneously within a gastrulating embryo, showing that cell movement characteristics are predominantly determined by its position within the embryo, independent of its germlayer identity. The spatially confined fate specification establishes a distinct distribution of cells in each germlayer during early gastrulation. The differences in the initial distribution are subsequently amplified by a unique global movement, which organizes the organ precursors along the embryonic body axis, giving rise to the blueprint of organ formation.},

  ABSTRACT = {We have developed an imaging system for 3D time-lapse polarization microscopy of living biological samples. Polarization imaging reveals the position, alignment and orientation of submicroscopic features in label-free as well as fluorescently labeled specimens. Optical anisotropies are calculated from a series of images where the sample is illuminated by light of different polarization states. Due to the number of images necessary to collect both multiple polarization states and multiple focal planes, 3D polarization imaging is most often prohibitively slow. Our MF-PolScope system employs multifocus optics to form an instantaneous 3D image of up to 25 simultaneous focal-planes. We describe this optical system and show examples of 3D multi-focus polarization imaging of biological samples, including a protein assembly study in budding yeast cells.},

@ARTICLE{vaziriMultilayerThreeDimensionalSuper2008,
  ABSTRACT = {Recent advances in optical microscopy have enabled biological imaging beyond the diffraction limit at nanometer resolution. A general feature of most of the techniques based on photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) or stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) has been the use of thin biological samples in combination with total internal reflection, thus limiting the imaging depth to a fraction of an optical wavelength. However, to study whole cells or organelles that are typically up to 15 μm deep into the cell, the extension of these methods to a three-dimensional (3D) super resolution technique is required. Here, we report an advance in optical microscopy that enables imaging of protein distributions in cells with a lateral localization precision better than 50 nm at multiple imaging planes deep in biological samples. The approach is based on combining the lateral super resolution provided by PALM with two-photon temporal focusing that provides optical sectioning. We have generated super-resolution images over an axial range of \$\textbackslash{}approx\$10 μm in both mitochondrially labeled fixed cells, and in the membranes of living S2 Drosophila cells.},

@ARTICLE{zhangListeningMembranePotential2017a,
  ABSTRACT = {Abstract. Voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) are designed to monitor membrane potential by detecting fluorescence changes in response to neuronal or muscle electrical activity. However, fluorescence imaging is limited by depth of penetration and high scattering losses, which leads to low sensitivity in vivo systems for external detection. By contrast, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, an emerging modality, is capable of deep tissue, noninvasive imaging by combining near-infrared light excitation and ultrasound detection. Here, we show that voltage-dependent quenching of dye fluorescence leads to a reciprocal enhancement of PA intensity. We synthesized a near-infrared photoacoustic VSD (PA-VSD), whose PA intensity change is sensitive to membrane potential. In the polarized state, this cyanine-based probe enhances PA intensity while decreasing fluorescence output in a lipid vesicle membrane model. A theoretical model accounts for how the experimental PA intensity change depends on fluorescence and absorbance properties of the dye. These results not only demonstrate PA voltage sensing but also emphasize the interplay of both fluorescence and absorbance properties in the design of optimized PA probes. Together, our results demonstrate PA sensing as a potential new modality for recording and external imaging of electrophysiological and neurochemical events in the brain.},

@ARTICLE{moffittHighPerformanceMultiplexedFluorescence2016,
  ABSTRACT = {Highly multiplexed single-molecule FISH has emerged as a promising approach to spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics because of its ability to directly image and profile numerous RNA species in their native cellular context. However, background—from off-target binding of FISH probes and cellular autofluorescence—can become limiting in a number of important applications, such as increasing the degree of multiplexing, imaging shorter RNAs, and imaging tissue samples. Here, we developed a sample clearing approach for FISH measurements. We identified off-target binding of FISH probes to cellular components other than RNA, such as proteins, as a major source of background. To remove this source of background, we embedded samples in polyacrylamide, anchored RNAs to this polyacrylamide matrix, and cleared cellular proteins and lipids, which are also sources of autofluorescence. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we measured the copy number of 130 RNA species in cleared samples using multiplexed error-robust FISH (MERFISH). We observed a reduction both in the background because of off-target probe binding and in the cellular autofluorescence without detectable loss in RNA. This process led to an improved detection efficiency and detection limit of MERFISH, and an increased measurement throughput via extension of MERFISH into four color channels. We further demonstrated MERFISH measurements of complex tissue samples from the mouse brain using this matrix-imprinting and -clearing approach. We envision that this method will improve the performance of a wide range of in situ hybridization-based techniques in both cell culture and tissues.},

@ARTICLE{kaufmannMultilayerMountingEnables2012,
  ABSTRACT = {Skip to Next Section Light sheet microscopy techniques, such as selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), are ideally suited for time-lapse imaging of developmental processes lasting several hours to a few days. The success of this promising technology has mainly been limited by the lack of suitable techniques for mounting fragile samples. Embedding zebrafish embryos in agarose, which is common in conventional confocal microscopy, has resulted in severe growth defects and unreliable results. In this study, we systematically quantified the viability and mobility of zebrafish embryos mounted under more suitable conditions. We found that tubes made of fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) filled with low concentrations of agarose or methylcellulose provided an optimal balance between sufficient confinement of the living embryo in a physiological environment over 3 days and optical clarity suitable for fluorescence imaging. We also compared the effect of different concentrations of Tricaine on the development of zebrafish and provide guidelines for its optimal use depending on the application. Our results will make light sheet microscopy techniques applicable to more fields of developmental biology, in particular the multiview long-term imaging of zebrafish embryos and other small organisms. Furthermore, the refinement of sample preparation for in toto and in vivo imaging will promote other emerging optical imaging techniques, such as optical projection tomography (OPT).},

  ABSTRACT = {Summary Understanding how mechanics complement bio-signaling in defining patterns during morphogenesis is an outstanding challenge. Here, we utilize the multicellular polyp Hydra to investigate the role of the actomyosin cytoskeleton in morphogenesis. We find that the supra-cellular actin fiber organization is inherited from the parent Hydra and determines the body axis in regenerating tissue segments. This form of structural inheritance is non-trivial because of the tissue folding and dynamic actin reorganization involved. We further show that the emergence of multiple body axes can be traced to discrepancies in actin fiber alignment at early stages of the regeneration process. Mechanical constraints induced by anchoring regenerating Hydra on stiff wires suppressed the emergence of multiple body axes, highlighting the importance of mechanical feedbacks in defining and stabilizing the body axis. Together, these results constitute an important step toward the development of an integrated view of morphogenesis that incorporates mechanics.},

  ABSTRACT = {Asymmetric cell divisions are of fundamental importance for developmental processes, e.g. for the generation of founder cells. Prime examples are asymmetric cell divisions in the P lineage during early embryogenesis of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. However, due to a lack of quantitative data it has remained unclear how frequent unequal daughter cell sizes emerge in the nematode's early embryogenesis, and whether these originate from sterical or biochemical cues. Using quantitative light-sheet microscopy, we have found that about 40\% of all cell divisions in C. elegans until gastrulation generate daughter cells with significantly different volumes. Removing the embryo's rigid eggshell revealed asymmetric divisions in somatic cells to be primarily induced by steric effects. Division asymmetries in the germline remained unaltered and were correctly reproduced by a model based on a cell-size independent, eccentric displacement of the metaphase plate. Our data suggest asymmetric cell divisions to be essential for establishing important cell-cell interactions that eventually fuel a successful embryogenesis.},

  ABSTRACT = {During development coordinated cell behaviors orchestrate tissue and organ morphogenesis to suit the lifestyle of the organism.

Transgenic Parhyale embryos with fluorescently labeled nuclei were imaged at high spatiotemporal resolution with multi-view light-sheet fluorescence microscopy over several days of embryogenesis spanning appendage morphogenesis from early specification up to late differentiation stages. Cell tracking with a new tool called Massive Multi-view Tracker (MaMuT) enabled the reconstruction of the complete cell lineage of an outgrowing thoracic limb with single-cell resolution. In silico clonal analyses suggested that the limb primordium becomes subdivided from an early stage first into anterior-posterior and then into dorsal-ventral compartments whose boundaries intersect at the distal tip of the growing limb. Limb bud formation is associated with the spatial modulation of cell proliferation, while limb elongation is also driven by the preferential orientation of division of epidermal cells along the proximal-distal axis of growth. Cellular reconstructions were predictive of the expression patterns of limb development genes including the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) morphogen.},

  ABSTRACT = {Dysregulation of the basal autophagic flux has been linked to several pathological conditions, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. In addition, autophagy has profound effects on the response of tumor cells to therapy. Hence, the search for pharmacological modulators of autophagy is of great clinical relevance. We established a drug screening assay in which the autophagic flux is measured by recording the fluorescence emission of the tandem fusion protein mRFP-GFP-LC3 by dynamic live-cell imaging. We optimized the assay for the identification of autophagy modulators in three dimensions with U343 glioma cell spheroids, which represent a more realistic cancer model than conventional 2D cell cultures. We validated the assay by screening a library of known autophagy modulators. As the first application, a small library of 94 natural compounds was screened for its impact on autophagy. We discovered the cyclic ionophore nonactin as a new and potent autophagy inducer. This novel autophagy screening assay based on 3D tumor spheroids is robust, reproducible, and scalable. It provides a valuable tool for both basic research and drug screening campaigns.},

  ABSTRACT = {The precise localization of nanometric objects in three dimensions is essential to identify functional diffusion mechanisms in complex systems at the cellular or molecular level. However, most optical methods can achieve high temporal resolution and high localization precision only in two dimensions or over a limited axial (z) range. Here we develop a novel wide-field detection system based on an electrically tunable lens that can track multiple individual nanoscale emitters in three dimensions over a tunable axial range with nanometric localization precision. The optical principle of the technique is based on the simultaneous acquisition of two images with an extended depth of field while encoding the z position of the emitters via a lateral shift between images. We provide a theoretical framework for this approach and demonstrate tracking of free diffusing beads and GABAA receptors in live neurons. This approach allows getting nanometric localization precision up to an axial range above 10 μm with a high numerical aperture lens—quadruple that of a typical 3D tracking system. Synchronization or complex fitting procedures are not requested here, which leads to a suitable architecture for localizing single molecules in four dimensions, namely, three dimensions in real-time.},

  ABSTRACT = {Many embryonic organs undergo branching morphogenesis to maximize their functional epithelial surface area. Branching morphogenesis requires the coordinated interplay of multiple types of cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM). During branching morphogenesis, new branches form by “budding” or “clefting.” Cell migration, proliferation, rearrangement, deformation, and ECM dynamics have varied roles in driving budding versus clefting in different organs. Elongation of the newly formed branch and final maturation of the tip involve cellular mechanisms that include cell elongation, intercalation, convergent extension, proliferation, and differentiation. New methodologies such as high-resolution live imaging, tension sensors, and force-mapping techniques are providing exciting new opportunities for future research into branching morphogenesis.},

  ABSTRACT = {Optogenetics allows precise, fast and reversible intervention in biological processes. Coupled with light-sheet microscopy, this approach allows unparalleled insight into the regulation of signaling pathways and cellular processes from a spatial and temporal perspective in vivo. To develop this method, we investigated the spatial and temporal regulation of canonical Wnt signaling during anterior-posterior patterning of the Drosophila embryonic epidermis. Cryptochrome C (Cry2) from Arabidopsis Thaliana was fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and Drosophila β-catenin to form an easy to visualize optogenetic switch. Blue light illumination caused reversible oligomerization of the fusion protein and inhibited downstream Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo. Temporal inactivation of β-catenin showed that Wnt signaling is required not only for Drosophila patterning formation, but also for maintenance throughout development. By applying light-sheet microscopy to activate the pathway and then record subsequent behavior in toto, we show precise spatial regulation of Wnt signaling in vivo. We anticipate that this method will be easily extendable to other developmental signaling pathways and many other experimental systems.},

  ABSTRACT = {The ability of fast and single-neuron resolution imaging of neural activities enables light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) as a powerful imaging technique in functional neural connection applications. The state-of-art LSFM imaging system can record the neuronal activities of entire brain for small animal, such as zebrafish or C. elegans at single-neuron resolution. However, the stimulated and spontaneous movements in animal brain result in inconsistent neuron positions during recording process. It is time consuming to register the acquired large-scale images with conventional method. In this work, we address the problem of fast registration of neural positions in stacks of LSFM images. This is necessary to register brain structures and activities. To achieve fast registration of neural activities, we present a rigid registration architecture by implementation of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). In this approach, the image stacks were preprocessed on GPU by mean stretching to reduce the computation effort. The present image was registered to the previous image stack that considered as reference. A fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm was used for calculating the shift of the image stack. The calculations for image registration were performed in different threads while the preparation functionality was refactored and called only once by the master thread. We implemented our registration algorithm on NVIDIA Quadro K4200 GPU under Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) programming environment. The experimental results showed that the registration computation can speed-up to 550ms for a full high-resolution brain image. Our approach also has potential to be used for other dynamic image registrations in biomedical applications.},

  ABSTRACT = {The zebrafish has become an established model in neuroscience due to the ease with which gene discovery, chemical screening, behaviour, and disease modelling can be performed. More recently, neuroimaging, a crucial pre-clinical technique for probing tissue structure, examining volumetric changes, and studying in vivo brain activity has also been applied to zebrafish. The zebrafish brain is particularly attractive for neuroimaging due to its small size, numerous translucent strains, and distinct forebrain organization. In this chapter we discuss the range of imaging techniques which have been utilized to examine the zebrafish brain. While many of these methods have only begun to be utilized in zebrafish, correlating neuroimaging phenotypes with behaviour in zebrafish has a bright future.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose a Light-sheet laser interference lithography technique for fabricating periodic microfluidic channels. This technique uses multiple light-sheet illumination pattern that is generated using a spatial filter at the back-aperture of the cylindrical lens. Specially designed spatial filter is used that give rise to a periodic pattern at the focal plane which is essentially a 1D Fourier transform of the spatial filter transfer function. One-dimensional focusing property of the cylindrical lens result in the generation of line shaped channel geometry. To design microfluidic channels, the illumination pattern is exposed to the glass substrate coated with a photopolymer sensitized to 532 nm and subsequently developed using standard chemical protocols. Experimentally, the 1D periodic channel structure has an approximate width and periodicity of approximately 11.25 microns. Light-sheets based lithography technique offer a fast and single-shot process to generate microfluidic channels.},

  ABSTRACT = {Under mechanical loading, most living cells show a viscoelastic deformation that follows a power law in time. After removal of the mechanical load, the cell shape recovers only incompletely to its original undeformed configuration. Here, we show that incomplete shape recovery is due to an additive plastic deformation that displays the same power-law dynamics as the fully reversible viscoelastic deformation response. Moreover, the plastic deformation is a constant fraction of the total cell deformation and originates from bond ruptures within the cytoskeleton. A simple extension of the prevailing viscoelastic power-law response theory with a plastic element correctly predicts the cell behaviour under cyclic loading. Our findings show that plastic energy dissipation during cell deformation is tightly linked to elastic cytoskeletal stresses, which suggests the existence of an adaptive mechanism that protects the cell against mechanical damage.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recording light-microscopy images of large, nontransparent specimens, such as developing multicellular organisms, is complicated by decreased contrast resulting from light scattering. Early zebrafish development can be captured by standard light-sheet microscopy, but new imaging strategies are required to obtain high-quality data of late development or of less transparent organisms. We combined digital scanned laser light-sheet fluorescence microscopy with incoherent structured-illumination microscopy (DSLM-SI) and created structured-illumination patterns with continuously adjustable frequencies. Our method discriminates the specimen-related scattered background from signal fluorescence, thereby removing out-of-focus light and optimizing the contrast of in-focus structures. DSLM-SI provides rapid control of the illumination pattern, exceptional imaging quality and high imaging speeds. We performed long-term imaging of zebrafish development for 58 h and fast multiple-view imaging of early Drosophila melanogaster development. We reconstructed cell positions over time from the Drosophila DSLM-SI data and created a fly digital embryo. View full text},

  ABSTRACT = {The ever-increasing speed and resolution of modern microscopes make the storage and post-processing of images challenging and prevent thorough statistical analyses in developmental biology. Here, instead of deploying massive storage and computing power, we exploit the spherical geometry of zebrafish embryos by computing a radial maximum intensity projection in real time with a 240-fold reduction in data rate. In our four-lens selective plane illumination microscope (SPIM) setup the development of multiple embryos is recorded in parallel and a map of all labelled cells is obtained for each embryo in \${$<\$$}10 s. In these panoramic projections, cell segmentation and flow analysis reveal characteristic migration patterns and global tissue remodelling in the early endoderm. Merging data from many samples uncover stereotypic patterns that are fundamental to endoderm development in every embryo. We demonstrate that processing and compressing raw image data in real time is not only efficient but indispensable for image-based systems biology.},

  ABSTRACT = {Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are at the origin of adult hematopoiesis, providing an organism with all blood cell types needed throughout life. During embryonic development a first wave of hematopoiesis (independent of HSCs) allows the survival and growth of the embryo until birth. A second wave of hematopoiesis that will last into adulthood depends on the production of HSCs that begins at mid-gestation in large arteries such as the aorta. HSC production occurs through a hemogenic endothelial to hematopoietic transition (EHT) process and the formation of hematopoietic clusters in most vertebrate species. Advances in understanding EHT, cluster formation and HSC production were triggered by combined progresses made in the development of in vivo assays, microscopy, imaging and fluorescence tools. Here, we review the current knowledge on developmental hematopoiesis with a focus on the first step of HSC production in the aorta and how microscopic approaches have contributed to a better understanding of the vital process of blood cell formation.},

We demonstrate that optical tissue clearing of intact rat retinas and light-sheet microscopy provides rapid 3-D characterization of vascular complexity during retinal development. Compared with flat mount preparations that dissect the retina and primarily image the outermost vascular layers, intact cleared retinas imaged using light-sheet fluorescence microscopy display changes in the 3-D retinal vasculature rapidly without the need for point scanning techniques. Using a severe model of retinal vascular disruption, we demonstrate that a simple metric based on Sholl analysis captures the vascular changes observed during retinal development in 3-D. Taken together, these results provide a methodology for rapidly quantifying the 3-D development of the entire rodent retinal vasculature.},

  ABSTRACT = {Peeking in on osteoprogenitors The eyes may be the windows to the soul, but a window into the bone—specifically bone marrow—would be useful for studying bone development and disease. Greenbaum et al. developed a method of whole-bone optical clearing, using a series of reagents under continuous flow to delipidate and decalcify bone tissue. This process renders the entire bone transparent but does not affect endogenous fluorescence, making this compatible with reporter mice. Using light sheet fluorescence microscopy, the authors counted and mapped the number of fluorescently labeled osteoprogenitors within cleared mouse tibia, vertebral column, and femur bones treated with sclerostin antibody. With reduced variability compared to standard section analysis, this Bone CLARITY and computational analysis will be a useful tool for bone research. Bone tissue harbors unique and essential physiological processes, such as hematopoiesis, bone growth, and bone remodeling. To enable visualization of these processes at the cellular level in an intact environment, we developed “Bone CLARITY,” a bone tissue clearing method. We used Bone CLARITY and a custom-built light-sheet fluorescence microscope to detect the endogenous fluorescence of Sox9-tdTomato+ osteoprogenitor cells in the tibia, femur, and vertebral column of adult transgenic mice. To obtain a complete distribution map of these osteoprogenitor cells, we developed a computational pipeline that semiautomatically detects individual Sox9-tdTomato+ cells in their native three-dimensional environment. Our computational method counted all labeled osteoprogenitor cells without relying on sampling techniques and displayed increased precision when compared with traditional stereology techniques for estimating the total number of these rare cells. We demonstrate the value of the clearing-imaging pipeline by quantifying changes in the population of Sox9-tdTomato–labeled osteoprogenitor cells after sclerostin antibody treatment. Bone tissue clearing is able to provide fast and comprehensive visualization of biological processes in intact bone tissue. Bone clearing and light-sheet microscopy enables visualization and quantification of fluorescent single cells in intact bone. Bone clearing and light-sheet microscopy enables visualization and quantification of fluorescent single cells in intact bone.},

  ABSTRACT = {We demonstrate that a compact manometer experiment allows direct observation of a delay to the classical electric-field-induced Freedericksz transition produced by flow in a highly dispersive nematic liquid crystal layer. The Ericksen-Leslie equations are used to show that a flow aligning torque generated in the nematic layer under Poiseuille flow competes with the orthogonal electric-field reorientation torque. This model fully reproduces the experimental results using only self-consistently determined viscosity values, and predicts a more generally applicable expression for the dependence of the delay Ec∝√ζ/Δχe on the shear rate ζ and on the electric susceptibility anisotropy Δχe.},

  ABSTRACT = {We describe the construction of a simplified, inexpensive lattice light-sheet microscope, and illustrate its use for imaging subcellular Ca2+ puffs evoked by photoreleased i-IP3 in cultured SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells loaded with the Ca2+ probe Cal520. The microscope provides sub-micron spatial resolution and enables recording of local Ca2+ transients in single-slice mode with a signal-to-noise ratio and temporal resolution (2 ms) at least as good as confocal or total internal reflection microscopy. Signals arising from openings of individual IP3R channels are clearly resolved, as are stepwise changes in fluorescence reflecting openings and closings of individual channels during puffs. Moreover, by stepping the specimen through the light-sheet, the entire volume of a cell can be scanned within a few hundred ms. The ability to directly visualize a sideways (axial) section through cells directly reveals that IP3-evoked Ca2+ puffs originate at sites in very close (≤a few hundred nm) to the plasma membrane, suggesting they play a specific role in signaling to the membrane.},

  ABSTRACT = {We propose and demonstrate a light-sheet-based 3D interrogation system on a microfluidic platform for screening biological specimens during flow. To achieve this, a diffraction-limited light-sheet (with a large field-of-view) is employed to optically section the specimens flowing through the microfluidic channel. This necessitates optimization of the parameters for the illumination sub-system (illumination intensity, light-sheet width, and thickness), microfluidic specimen platform (channel-width and flow-rate), and detection sub-system (camera exposure time and frame rate). Once optimized, these parameters facilitate cross-sectional imaging and 3D reconstruction of biological specimens. The proposed integrated light-sheet imaging and flow-based enquiry (iLIFE) imaging technique enables single-shot sectional imaging of a range of specimens of varying dimensions, ranging from a single cell (HeLa cell) to a multicellular organism (C. elegans). 3D reconstruction of the entire C. elegans is achieved in real-time and with an exposure time of few hundred micro-seconds. A maximum likelihood technique is developed and optimized for the iLIFE imaging system. We observed an intracellular resolution for mitochondria-labeled HeLa cells, which demonstrates the dynamic resolution of the iLIFE system. The proposed technique is a step towards achieving flow-based 3D imaging. We expect potential applications in diverse fields such as structural biology and biophysics.},

@ARTICLE{maurerImpactXanthanGum2012,
  ABSTRACT = {Mixed carbohydrate systems are of special interest for the food and non-food industry as they offer a versatile range of unique and novel functional properties. However, intense research is required to understand the complex processes occurring in such systems on a molecular level and to be able to modify them aim-oriented. In food, characteristic properties are based on the physicochemical functions of the biopolymers added. Thus, small deformation tests and moisture analysis have been applied to study the impact of xanthan gum and two types of sugar on the viscoelastic properties, the sol–gel transition and the water holding capacity of 1\% agarose hydrogels. Agarose gels are very elastic, turbid and prone to synaeresis, which impinges on their mouth feeling. Additions of xanthan gum revealed less elastic gels with an unaffected water holding capacity. Progressive addition of two different types of up to 40\% of sugar yield an increase of the elasticity of agarose gels, whereby sugar concentrations of 60\% partially result in a structural breakdown and thus a significant lower network structure but better water holding. In ternary systems, the effect of the sugar concentration and sugar type used is diminished by xanthan gum. The gelation mechanism of agarose gels with a distinct amount of co-solutes is presumably mainly affected by the water shortage evolved from the competition for it of all solutes present.},

@ARTICLE{floodUsingHydrogelsMicroscopy2016,
  ABSTRACT = {Sample preparation for microscopy is a crucial step to ensure the best experimental outcome. It often requires the use of specific mounting media that have to be tailored to not just the sample but the chosen microscopy technique. The media must not damage the sample or impair the optical path, and may also have to support the correct physiological function/development of the sample. For decades, researchers have used embedding media such as hydrogels to maintain samples in place. Their ease of use and transparency has promoted them as mainstream mounting media. However, they are not as straightforward to implement as assumed. They can contain contaminants, generate forces on the sample, have complex diffusion and structural properties that are influenced by multiple factors and are generally not designed for microscopy in mind. This short review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using hydrogels for microscopy sample preparation and highlight some of the less obvious problems associated with the area.},

  ABSTRACT = {The ability to measure dynamic structural changes within a cell under applied load is essential for developing more accurate models of cell mechanics and mechanotransduction. Atomic force microscopy is a powerful tool for evaluating cell mechanics, but the dominant applied forces and sample strains are in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the imaging plane of standard fluorescence imaging. Here we report on a combined sideways imaging and vertical light sheet illumination system integrated with AFM. Our system enables high frame rate, low background imaging of subcellular structural dynamics in the vertical plane synchronized with AFM force data. Using our system for cell compression measurements, we correlated stiffening features in the force indentation data with onset of nuclear deformation revealed in the imaging data. In adhesion studies we were able to correlate detailed features in the force data during adhesive release events with strain at the membrane and within the nucleus.},

  ABSTRACT = {Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) develops at unpredictable locations around lung bronchi following pulmonary inflammation. The formation and composition of BALT have primarily been investigated by immunohistology that, due to the size of the invested organ, is usually restricted to a limited number of histological sections. To assess the entire BALT of the lung, other approaches are urgently needed. Here, we introduce a novel light sheet microscopy-based approach for assessing lymphoid tissue in the lung. Using antibody staining of whole lung lobes and optical clearing by organic solvents, we present a method that allows in-depth visualization of the entire bronchial tree, the lymphatic vasculature and the immune cell composition of the induced BALT. Furthermore, three-dimensional analysis of the entire lung allows the qualitative and quantitative enumeration of the induced BALT. Using this approach, we show that a single intranasal application of the replication-deficient poxvirus MVA induces BALT that constitutes up to 8\% of the entire lung volume in mice deficient in CCR7, in contrast to wild type mice (WT). Furthermore, BALT induced by heat-inactivated E. coli is dominated by a pronounced T cell infiltration in Cxcr5-deficient mice, in contrast to WT mice.},

@ARTICLE{vangindertaelIntroductionOpticalSuperresolution2018,
  ABSTRACT = {Abstract Ever since the inception of light microscopy, the laws of physics have seemingly thwarted every attempt to visualize the processes of life at its most fundamental, sub- cellular, level. The diffraction limit has restricted our view to length scales well above 250 nm and in doing so, severely compromised our ability to gain true insights into many biological systems. Fortunately, continuous advancements in optics, electronics and mathematics have since provided the means to once again make physics work to our advantage. Even though some of the fundamental concepts enabling super-resolution light microscopy have been known for quite some time, practically feasible implementations have long remained elusive. It should therefore not come as a surprise that the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to the scientists who, each in their own way, contributed to transforming super-resolution microscopy from a technological tour de force to a staple of the biologist’s toolkit. By breaking the diffraction barrier, light microscopy could once again be established as an indispensable tool in an age where the importance of understanding life at the molecular level cannot be overstated. This review strives to provide the aspiring life science researcher with an introduction to optical microscopy, starting from the fundamental concepts governing compound and fluorescent confocal microscopy to the current state},

  ABSTRACT = {This paper is intended to give a comprehensive review of light-sheet (LS) microscopy from an optics perspective. As such, emphasis is placed on the advantages that LS microscope configurations present, given the degree of freedom gained by uncoupling the excitation and detection arms. The new imaging properties are first highlighted in terms of optical parameters and how these have enabled several biomedical applications. Then, the basics are presented for understanding how a LS microscope works. This is followed by a presentation of a tutorial for LS microscope designs, each working at different resolutions and for different applications. Then, based on a numerical Fourier analysis and given the multiple possibilities for generating the LS in the microscope (using Gaussian, Bessel, and Airy beams in the linear and nonlinear regimes), a systematic comparison of their optical performance is presented. Finally, based on advances in optics and photonics, the novel optical implementations possible in a LS microscope are highlighted.},

@ARTICLE{faoroAberrationcorrectedCryoimmersionLight2018,
  ABSTRACT = {Cryogenic fluorescent light microscopy of flash-frozen cells stands out by artifact-free fixation and very little photobleaching of the fluorophores used. To attain the highest level of resolution, aberration-free immersion objectives with accurately matched immersion media are required, but both do not exist for imaging below the glass-transition temperature of water. Here, we resolve this challenge by combining a cryoimmersion medium, HFE-7200, which matches the refractive index of room-temperature water, with a technological concept in which the body of the objective and the front lens are not in thermal equilibrium. We implemented this concept by replacing the metallic front-lens mount of a standard bioimaging water immersion objective with an insulating ceramic mount heated around its perimeter. In this way, the objective metal housing can be maintained at room temperature, while creating a thermally shielded cold microenvironment around the sample and front lens. To demonstrate the range of potential applications, we show that our method can provide superior contrast in Escherichia coli and yeast cells expressing fluorescent proteins and resolve submicrometer structures in multicolor immunolabeled human bone osteosarcoma epithelial (U2OS) cells at −140°−140°{$<$}mml:math xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"{$><$}mml:mrow{$><$}mml:mo{$>$}−{$<$}/mml:mo{$><$}mml:mn{$>$}140{$<$}/mml:mn{$><$}mml:mo{$>$}°{$<$}/mml:mo{$><$}/mml:mrow{$><$}/mml:math{$>$}C.},

  ABSTRACT = {We present a fast calculation of the electromagnetic field near the focus of an objective with a high numerical aperture (NA). Instead of direct integration, the vectorial Debye diffraction integral is evaluated with the fast Fourier transform for calculating the electromagnetic field in the entire focal region. We generalize this concept with the chirp z transform for obtaining a flexible sampling grid and an additional gain in computation speed. Under the conditions for the validity of the Debye integral representation, our method yields the amplitude, phase and polarization of the focus field for an arbitrary paraxial input field on the objective. We present two case studies by calculating the focus fields of a 40×1.20 NA water immersion objective for different amplitude distributions of the input field, and a 100×1.45 NA oil immersion objective containing evanescent field contributions for both linearly and radially polarized input fields.},

@ARTICLE{duocastellaFastInertiaFreeVolumetric2017c,
  ABSTRACT = {Fast noninvasive three-dimensional (3D) imaging is crucial for quantitatively studying highly dynamic events ranging from flow cytometry to developmental biology. Light-sheet microscopy has emerged as the tool-of-choice for 3D characterization of rapidly evolving systems. However, to obtain a 3D image, either the sample or parts of the microscope are moved, limiting the acquisition speed. Here, we propose a novel inertia-free light-sheet-based scheme for volumetric imaging at high temporal resolution. Our approach comprises a novel combination of an acousto-optic scanner to produce tailored illumination and an acoustic-optofluidic lens, placed in the detection path to provide extended depth-of-field. Such a combination enables unsurpassed 3D imaging speeds up to 200 volumes per second. The volumetric imaging speed is limited only by the acquisition frame rate of the camera and the desired signal-to-noise ratio. Our volumetric microscope allows for invariant acquisition along the detection axis, avoiding extensive processing or complex deconvolution methods to restore image quality.},

@ARTICLE{fahrbachRapid3DLightsheet2013,
  ABSTRACT = {The in-vivo investigation of highly dynamic biological samples, for example the beating zebrafish heart, requires high-speed volume imaging techniques. Light-sheet microscopy is ideal for such samples as it records high-contrast images of entire planes within large samples at once. However, in order to obtain images of different planes, it has been necessary to move the sample relative to the fixed focal plane of the detection objective lens. This mechanical movement limits speed, precision and may be harmful to the sample. We have built a light-sheet microscope that uses remote focusing with an electrically tunable lens (ETL). Without moving specimen or objective we have thereby achieved flexible volume imaging at much higher speeds than previously reported. Our high-speed microscope delivers 3D snapshots of sensitive biological samples. As an example, we imaged 17 planes within a beating zebrafish heart at 510 frames per second, equivalent to 30 volume scans per second. Movements, shape changes and signals across the entire volume can be followed which has been impossible with existing reconstruction techniques.},

  ABSTRACT = {The impact of light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is visible in fields as diverse as developmental and cell biology, anatomical science, biophysics and neuroscience. Although adoption among biologists has been steady, LSFM has not displaced more traditional imaging methods despite its often-superior performance. One reason for this is that the field has largely conformed to a do-it-yourself ethic, although the challenges of big image data cannot be overstated. With the most powerful implementations of LSFM available to only a few groups worldwide, the scope of this technique is unnecessarily limited. Here we elucidate the key developments and define a simple set of underlying principles governing LSFM. In doing so, we aim to clarify the decisions to be made for those who wish to develop and use bespoke light-sheet systems and to assist in identifying the best approaches to apply this powerful technique to myriad biological questions.},

  ABSTRACT = {We report the development of a modular and optimized thin-sheet laser imaging microscope (TSLIM) for nondestructive optical sectioning of organisms and thick tissues such as the mouse cochlea, zebrafish brain/inner ear, and rat brain at a resolution that is comparable to wide-field fluorescence microscopy. TSLIM optically sections tissue using a thin sheet of light by inducing a plane of fluorescence in transparent or fixed and cleared tissues. Moving the specimen through the thinnest portion of the light sheet and stitching these image columns together results in optimal resolution and focus across the width of a large specimen. Dual light sheets and aberration-corrected objectives provide uniform section illumination and reduce absorption artifacts that are common in light-sheet microscopy. Construction details are provided for duplication of a TSLIM device by other investigators in order to encourage further use and development of this important technology.},

  ABSTRACT = {Light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), also termed single plane illumination microscopy (SPIM), enables live cell fluorescence imaging with optical sectioning capabilities superior to confocal microscopy and without any out-of-focus exposure of the specimen. However, the need of two objective lenses, one for light-sheet illumination and one for imaging, imposes geometrical constraints that require LSFM setups to be adapted to the specific needs of different types of specimen in order to obtain optimal imaging conditions. Here we demonstrate the use of an oblique light-sheet configuration adapted to provide the highest possible Gaussian beam enabled resolution in LSFM. The oblique light-sheet configuration furthermore enables LSFM imaging at the surface of a cover slip, without the need of specific sample mounting. In addition, the system is compatible with simultaneous high NA wide-field epi-fluorescence imaging of the specimen contained in a glass-bottom cell culture dish. This prevents cumbersome sample mounting and enables rapid screening of large areas of the specimen followed by high-resolution LSFM imaging of selected cells. We demonstrate the application of this microscope for in toto imaging of endocytosis in yeast, showing for the first time imaging of all endocytic events of a given cell over a period of {$>$}5 minutes with sub-second resolution.},

  ABSTRACT = {Multidirectional selective plane illumination microscopy (mSPIM) reduces absorption and scattering artifacts and provides an evenly illuminated focal plane. mSPIM solves two common problems in light-sheet-based imaging techniques: The shadowing in the excitation path due to absorption in the specimen is eliminated by pivoting the light sheet; the spread of the light sheet by scattering in the sample is compensated by illuminating the sample consecutively from opposing directions. The resulting two images are computationally fused yielding a superior image. The effective light sheet is thinner, and the axial resolution is increased by square root 2 over single-directional SPIM. The multidirectional illumination proves essential in biological specimens such as millimeter-sized embryos. The performance of mSPIM is demonstrated by the imaging of live zebrafish embryos.},

@ARTICLE{chenouardMultipleHypothesisTracking2013,
  ABSTRACT = {In this paper, we present a method for simultaneously tracking thousands of targets in biological image sequences, which is of major importance in modern biology. The complexity and inherent randomness of the problem lead us to propose a unified probabilistic framework for tracking biological particles in microscope images. The framework includes realistic models of particle motion and existence, and of fluorescence image features. For the track extraction process per se, the very cluttered conditions motivate the adoption of a multiframe approach which enforces tracking decision robustness to poor imaging conditions and to random target movements. We tackle the large-scale nature of the problem by adapting the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking algorithm to the proposed framework, resulting in a method with a favorable trade-off between the model complexity and the computational cost of the tracking procedure. When compared to the state-of-the-art tracking techniques for bioimaging, the proposed algorithm is shown to be the only method providing high quality results despite the critically poor imaging conditions and the dense target presence. We thus demonstrate the benefits of advanced Bayesian tracking techniques for the accurate computational modeling of dynamical biological processes, which is promising for further developments in this domain.},

Instead of acquiring individual colours sequentially with filters, we created a platform based on line-scanning light sheet microscopy to record the entire spectrum for each pixel in a three-dimensional volume. We evaluated data sets with varying spectral sampling and determined the optimal channel width to be around 5 nm. With the help of these data sets, we show that our setup outperforms filter-based approaches with regard to image quality and discrimination of fluorophores. By spectral unmixing we resolved overlapping fluorophores with up to nanometre resolution and removed autofluorescence in zebrafish and fruit fly embryos.},

Tiling light-sheet selective plane illumination microscopy (TLS-SPIM) with real-time light-sheet optimization was developed to respond to the challenge. It improves the 3D imaging ability of SPIM in resolving complex structures and optimizes SPIM live imaging performance by using a real-time adjustable tiling light sheet and creating a flexible compromise between spatial and temporal resolution. We demonstrate the 3D live imaging ability of TLS-SPIM by imaging cellular and subcellular behaviours in live C. elegans and zebrafish embryos, and show how TLS-SPIM can facilitate cell biology research in multicellular specimens by studying left-right symmetry breaking behaviour of C. elegans embryos.},

  ABSTRACT = {A theoretical framework for widefield structured illumination microscopy (SIM) reconstruction from fewer than the commonly used nine raw frame acquisitions is introduced and applied in silico and in vitro. The proposed scheme avoids the recording of redundant spatial frequency components, which was necessary in previous SIM algorithms. This allows for gentler superresolution imaging at faster speeds. A doubling of frame rates is possible solely via changes in the computational reconstruction procedure. Furthermore, we explore numerically the effect of the sample movement on the reconstruction quality and the number of raw frames recordable. Our results show that there exists a limit above which deconvolution microscopy becomes superior to SIM.},

  ABSTRACT = {Existing super-resolution fluorescence microscopes compromise acquisition speed to provide subdiffractive sample information. We report an analog implementation of structured illumination microscopy that enables three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution imaging with a lateral resolution of 145 nm and an axial resolution of 350 nm at acquisition speeds up to 100 Hz. By using optical instead of digital image-processing operations, we removed the need to capture, store and combine multiple camera exposures, increasing data acquisition rates 10- to 100-fold over other super-resolution microscopes and acquiring and displaying super-resolution images in real time. Low excitation intensities allow imaging over hundreds of 2D sections, and combined physical and computational sectioning allow similar depth penetration to spinning-disk confocal microscopy. We demonstrate the capability of our system by imaging fine, rapidly moving structures including motor-driven organelles in human lung fibroblasts and the cytoskeleton of flowing blood cells within developing zebrafish embryos.},

  ABSTRACT = {Single particle tracking (SPT) in biological systems is a quickly growing field. Many new technologies are being developed providing new tracking capabilities, which also lead to higher demands and expectations for SPT. Following a single biomolecule as it performs its function provides quantitative mechanistic information that cannot be obtained in classical ensemble methods. From the 3D trajectory, information is available over the diffusional behavior of the particle and precise position information can also be used to elucidate interactions of the tracked particle with its surroundings. Thus, three-dimensional (3D) SPT is a very valuable tool for investigating cellular processes. This review presents recent progress in 3D SPT, from image-based techniques toward more sophisticated feedback approaches. We focus mainly on the feedback technique known as orbital tracking. We present here a modified version of the original orbital tracking in which the intensities from two z-planes are simultaneously measured allowing a concomitant wide-field imaging. The system can track single particles with a precision down to 5 nm in the x–y plane and 7 nm in the axial direction. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated using single virus tracing to follow the infection pathway of Prototype Foamy Virus in living cells.},

@ARTICLE{rinkRabConversionMechanism2005,
  ABSTRACT = {The mechanisms of endosome biogenesis and maintenance are largely unknown. The small GTPases Rab 5 and Rab 7 are key determinants of early and late endosomes, organizing effector proteins into specific membrane subdomains. Whether such Rab machineries are indefinitely maintained on membranes or can disassemble in the course of cargo transport is an open question. Here, we combined novel image-analysis algorithms with fast live-cell imaging. We found that the level of Rab 5 dynamically fluctuates on individual early endosomes, linked by fusion and fission events into a network in time. Within it, degradative cargo concentrates in progressively fewer and larger endosomes that migrate from the cell periphery to the center where Rab 5 is rapidly replaced with Rab 7. The class C VPS/HOPS complex, an established GEF for Rab 7, interacts with Rab 5 and is required for Rab 5-to-Rab 7 conversion. Our results reveal unexpected dynamics of Rab domains and suggest Rab conversion as the mechanism of cargo progression between early and late endosomes.},

  ABSTRACT = {Recent technological improvements have made it possible to examine the dynamics of individual vesicles at a very high temporal and spatial resolution. Quantification of the dynamic properties of secretory vesicles is labor-intensive and therefore it is crucial to develop software to automate the process of analyzing vesicle dynamics. Dual-threshold and binary image conversion were applied to enhance images and define the areas of objects of interest that were to be tracked. The movements, changes in fluorescence intensity, and changes in the area of each tracked object were measured using a new software system named the Protein Tracking system (PTrack). Simulations revealed that the system accurately recognized tracked objects and measured their dynamic properties. Comparison of the results from tracking real time-lapsed images manually with those automatically obtained using PTrack revealed similar patterns for changes in fluorescence intensity and a high accuracy ({$<$}89\%). According to tracking results, PTrack can distinguish different vesicular organelles that are similar in shape, based on their unique dynamic properties. In conclusion, the novel tracking system, PTrack, should facilitate automated quantification of the dynamic properties of vesicles that are important when classifying vesicular protein locations.

@ARTICLE{coraluppiRecursiveTrackFusion2004,
  ABSTRACT = {Most of the track fusion work documented in the literature involves a post-processing, batch approach to track-to-track association. Also, it is generally assumed that, due to bandwidth constraints, sensor contacts are unavailable to the track fusion system. Our work differs in that we develop a real-time, recursive approach to the track fusion problem. Further, our algorithm was developed for a centralized architecture, so that sensor data is available to the track fuser, allowing for improved track fusion performance. While the algorithm can be readily modified to operate in decentralized settings when bandwidth constraints are such that sensor contacts are unavailable to the track fuser, our work motivates a hierarchical, multi-stage approach to data fusion even in centralized settings. This is particularly useful when sensor revisit rates vary greatly.Our track fusion algorithm uses an efficient linear programming-based approach to data association and a customized version of the interacting multiple model (IMM) filter with precise calculations for model transition probabilities and for model-to-model filter predictions. Data association is based on kinematic as well as classification information. We present results based on ground target scenarios with move-stop-move targets, with target contacts originating from radar data (GMTI and SAR), electro-optical imagery, signal intelligence, and acoustic and seismic unattended ground sensors (UGS).},

@ARTICLE{thompsonPreciseNanometerLocalization2002,
  ABSTRACT = {Calculation of the centroid of the images of individual fluorescent particles and molecules allows localization and tracking in light microscopes to a precision about an order of magnitude greater than the microscope resolution. The factors that limit the precision of these techniques are examined and a simple equation derived that describes the precision of localization over a wide range of conditions. In addition, a localization algorithm motivated from least-squares fitting theory is constructed and tested both on image stacks of 30-nm fluorescent beads and on computer-generated images (Monte Carlo simulations). Results from the algorithm show good agreement with the derived precision equation for both the simulations and actual images. The availability of a simple equation to describe localization precision helps investigators both in assessing the quality of an experimental apparatus and in directing attention to the factors that limit further improvement. The precision of localization scales as the inverse square root of the number of photons in the spot for the shot noise limited case and as the inverse of the number of photons for the background noise limited case. The optimal image magnification depends on the expected number of photons and background noise, but, for most cases of interest, the pixel size should be about equal to the standard deviation of the point spread function.},

@ARTICLE{savinStaticDynamicErrors2005,
  ABSTRACT = {Particle tracking techniques are often used to assess the local mechanical properties of cells and biological fluids. The extracted trajectories are exploited to compute the mean-squared displacement that characterizes the dynamics of the probe particles. Limited spatial resolution and statistical uncertainty are the limiting factors that alter the accuracy of the mean-squared displacement estimation. We precisely quantified the effect of localization errors in the determination of the mean-squared displacement by separating the sources of these errors into two separate contributions. A "static error" arises in the position measurements of immobilized particles. A "dynamic error" comes from the particle motion during the finite exposure time that is required for visualization. We calculated the propagation of these errors on the mean-squared displacement. We examined the impact of our error analysis on theoretical model fluids used in biorheology. These theoretical predictions were verified for purely viscous fluids using simulations and a multiple-particle tracking technique performed with video microscopy. We showed that the static contribution can be confidently corrected in dynamics studies by using static experiments performed at a similar noise-to-signal ratio. This groundwork allowed us to achieve higher resolution in the mean-squared displacement, and thus to increase the accuracy of microrheology studies.},

@ARTICLE{tangCrystalStructuresMajor2007,
  ABSTRACT = {White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) is a virulent pathogen known to infect various crustaceans. It has bacilliform morphology with a tail-like appendage at one end. The envelope consists of four major proteins. Envelope structural proteins play a crucial role in viral infection and are believed to be the first molecules to interact with the host. Here, we report the localization and crystal structure of major envelope proteins VP26 and VP28 from WSSV at resolutions of 2.2 and 2.0 Å, respectively. These two proteins alone account for approximately 60\% of the envelope, and their structures represent the first two structural envelope proteins of WSSV. Structural comparisons among VP26, VP28, and other viral proteins reveal an evolutionary relationship between WSSV envelope proteins and structural proteins from other viruses. Both proteins adopt β-barrel architecture with a protruding N-terminal region. We have investigated the localization of VP26 and VP28 using immunoelectron microscopy. This study suggests that VP26 and VP28 are located on the outer surface of the virus and are observed as a surface protrusion in the WSSV envelope, and this is the first convincing observation for VP26. Based on our studies combined with the literature, we speculate that the predicted N-terminal transmembrane region of VP26 and VP28 may anchor on the viral envelope membrane, making the core β-barrel protrude outside the envelope, possibly to interact with the host receptor or to fuse with the host cell membrane for effective transfer of the viral infection. Furthermore, it is tempting to extend this host interaction mode to other structural viral proteins of similar structures. Our finding has the potential to extend further toward drug and vaccine development against WSSV.},

Force generation by actin-myosin networks and force transmission through adhesive complexes are two self-organizing phenomena driving tissue morphogenesis. Coordination and integration of forces by long-range force transmission and mechanosensing of cells within tissues produce large-scale tissue shape changes. Extrinsic mechanical forces also control tissue patterning by modulating cell fate specification and differentiation. Thus, the interplay between tissue mechanics and biochemical signaling orchestrates tissue morphogenesis and patterning in development.},

  ABSTRACT = {Embryonic morphogenesis requires the execution of complex mechanisms that regulate the local behaviour of groups of cells. The orchestration of such mechanisms has been mainly deciphered through the identification of conserved families of signalling pathways that spatially and temporally control cell behaviour. However, how this information is processed to control cell shape and cell dynamics is an open area of investigation. The framework that emerges from diverse disciplines such as cell biology, physics and developmental biology points to adhesion and cortical actin networks as regulators of cell surface mechanics. In this context, a range of developmental phenomena can be explained by the regulation of cell surface tension.},

@ARTICLE{fletcherVertexModelsEpithelial2014,
  ABSTRACT = {The dynamic behavior of epithelial cell sheets plays a central role during numerous developmental processes. Genetic and imaging studies of epithelial morphogenesis in a wide range of organisms have led to increasingly detailed mechanisms of cell sheet dynamics. Computational models offer a useful means by which to investigate and test these mechanisms, and have played a key role in the study of cell-cell interactions. A variety of modeling approaches can be used to simulate the balance of forces within an epithelial sheet. Vertex models are a class of such models that consider cells as individual objects, approximated by two-dimensional polygons representing cellular interfaces, in which each vertex moves in response to forces due to growth, interfacial tension, and pressure within each cell. Vertex models are used to study cellular processes within epithelia, including cell motility, adhesion, mitosis, and delamination. This review summarizes how vertex models have been used to provide insight into developmental processes and highlights current challenges in this area, including progressing these models from two to three dimensions and developing new tools for model validation.},

@ARTICLE{farhadifarInfluenceCellMechanics2007,
  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Epithelial junctional networks assume packing geometries characterized by different cell shapes, neighbor number distributions and areas. The development of specific packing geometries is tightly controlled; in the Drosophila wing epithelium, cells convert from an irregular to a hexagonal array shortly before hair formation. Packing geometry is determined by developmental mechanisms that likely control the biophysical properties of cells and their interactions. RESULTS: To understand how physical cellular properties and proliferation determine cell-packing geometries, we use a vertex model for the epithelial junctional network in which cell packing geometries correspond to stable and stationary network configurations. The model takes into account cell elasticity and junctional forces arising from cortical contractility and adhesion. By numerically simulating proliferation, we generate different network morphologies that depend on physical parameters. These networks differ in polygon class distribution, cell area variation, and the rate of T1 and T2 transitions during growth. Comparing theoretical results to observed cell morphologies reveals regions of parameter space where calculated network morphologies match observed ones. We independently estimate parameter values by quantifying network deformations caused by laser ablating individual cell boundaries. CONCLUSIONS: The vertex model accounts qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed packing geometry in the wing disc and its response to perturbation by laser ablation. Epithelial packing geometry is a consequence of both physical cellular properties and the disordering influence of proliferation. The occurrence of T2 transitions during network growth suggests that elimination of cells from the proliferating disc epithelium may be the result of junctional force balances.},

@ARTICLE{wargaCellMovementsEpiboly1990,
  ABSTRACT = {Beginning during the late blastula stage in zebrafish, cells located beneath a surface epithelial layer of the blastoderm undergo rearrangements that accompany major changes in shape of the embryo. We describe three distinctive kinds of cell rearrangements. (1) Radial cell intercalations during epiboly mix cells located deeply in the blastoderm among more superficial ones. These rearrangements thoroughly stir the positions of deep cells, as the blastoderm thins and spreads across the yolk cell. (2) Involution at or near the blastoderm margin occurs during gastrulation. This movement folds the blastoderm into two cellular layers, the epiblast and hypoblast, within a ring (the germ ring) around its entire circumference. Involuting cells move anteriorwards in the hypoblast relative to cells that remain in the epiblast; the movement shears the positions of cells that were neighbors before gastrulation. Involuting cells eventually form endoderm and mesoderm, in an anterior-posterior sequence according to the time of involution. The epiblast is equivalent to embryonic ectoderm. (3) Mediolateral cell intercalations in both the epiblast and hypoblast mediate convergence and extension movements towards the dorsal side of the gastrula. By this rearrangement, cells that were initially neighboring one another become dispersed along the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Epiboly, involution and convergent extension in zebrafish involve the same kinds of cellular rearrangements as in amphibians, and they occur during comparable stages of embryogenesis.},

@ARTICLE{kimmelStagesEmbryonicDevelopment1995,
  ABSTRACT = {We describe a series of stages for development of the embryo of the zebrafish, Danio (Brachydanio) rerio. We define seven broad periods of embryogenesis--the zygote, cleavage, blastula, gastrula, segmentation, pharyngula, and hatching periods. These divisions highlight the changing spectrum of major developmental processes that occur during the first 3 days after fertilization, and we review some of what is known about morphogenesis and other significant events that occur during each of the periods. Stages subdivide the periods. Stages are named, not numbered as in most other series, providing for flexibility and continued evolution of the staging series as we learn more about development in this species. The stages, and their names, are based on morphological features, generally readily identified by examination of the live embryo with the dissecting stereomicroscope. The descriptions also fully utilize the optical transparancy of the live embryo, which provides for visibility of even very deep structures when the embryo is examined with the compound microscope and Nomarski interference contrast illumination. Photomicrographs and composite camera lucida line drawings characterize the stages pictorially. Other figures chart the development of distinctive characters used as staging aid signposts.},

@ARTICLE{kaneZebrafishMidblastulaTransition1993,
  ABSTRACT = {The zebrafish midblastula transition (MBT) begins at cycle 10. It is characterized by cell cycle lengthening, loss of cell synchrony, activation of transcription and appearance of cell motility. Superceding a 15 minute oscillator that controls the first nine cycles, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio appears to govern the MBT. This timing mechanism operates cell autonomously: clones of labeled cells initiate cell cycle lengthening independently of neighbors but dependent on immediate lineal ancestors. Unequal divisions, when they occur, produce asymmetric cell cycle lengthening based on the volume of each daughter. During the several cycles after the MBT begins, cycle length is correlated with the reciprocal of the blastomere volume, suggesting a continuation of cell cycle regulation by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio during an interval that we term the 'MBT period'.},

@ARTICLE{forgacsViscoelasticPropertiesLiving1998,
  ABSTRACT = {A number of properties of certain living embryonic tissues can be explained by considering them as liquids. Tissue fragments left in a shaker bath round up to form spherical aggregates, as do liquid drops. When cells comprising two distinct embryonic tissues are mixed, typically a nucleation-like process takes place, and one tissue sorts out from the other. The equilibrium configurations at the end of such sorting out phenomena have been interpreted in terms of tissue surface tensions arising from the adhesive interactions between individual cells. In the present study we go beyond these equilibrium properties and study the viscoelastic behavior of a number of living embryonic tissues. Using a specifically designed apparatus, spherical cell aggregates are mechanically compressed and their viscoelastic response is followed. A generalized Kelvin model of viscoelasticity accurately describes the measured relaxation curves for each of the four tissues studied. Quantitative results are obtained for the characteristic relaxation times and elastic and viscous parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the cell aggregates studied here, when subjected to mechanical deformations, relax as elastic materials on short time scales and as viscous liquids on long time scales.},

We demonstrate the high spatial resolution of the SPIM-FLIM combination in the intensity domain as well as in the lifetime domain with latex bead samples and multiple recordings of three-dimensional live Madine-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cysts. We estimate that the bleaching rate after 600 images have been recorded is below 5\%.},

  ABSTRACT = {We use Richardson–Lucy (RL) deconvolution to combine multiple images of a simulated object into a single image in the context of modern fluorescence microscopy techniques. RL deconvolution can merge images with very different point-spread functions, such as in multiview light-sheet microscopes,1, 2 while preserving the best resolution information present in each image. We show that RL deconvolution is also easily applied to merge high-resolution, high-noise images with low-resolution, low-noise images, relevant when complementing conventional microscopy with localization microscopy. We also use RL deconvolution to merge images produced by different simulated illumination patterns, relevant to structured illumination microscopy (SIM)3, 4 and image scanning microscopy (ISM). The quality of our ISM reconstructions is at least as good as reconstructions using standard inversion algorithms for ISM data, but our method follows a simpler recipe that requires no mathematical insight. Finally, we apply RL deconvolution to merge a series of ten images with varying signal and resolution levels. This combination is relevant to gated stimulated-emission depletion (STED) microscopy, and shows that merges of high-quality images are possible even in cases for which a non-iterative inversion algorithm is unknown.},

Depending on magnification requirements, three methods of performing OPT are detailed using this adaptor plate: a conventional direct OPT method requiring only the addition of a limiting aperture behind the objective lens; an external optical-relay method allowing conventional OPT to be performed at magnifications {$>$}4x; a remote focal scanning and region-of-interest method for improved spatial resolution OPT (up to \textasciitilde{}1.6 μm). All three methods use the microscope’s existing incoherent light source (i.e. arc-lamp) and all of its inherent functionality is maintained for day-to-day use.

  ABSTRACT = {Optimal four-dimensional imaging requires high spatial resolution in all dimensions, high speed and minimal photobleaching and damage. We developed a dual-view, plane illumination microscope with improved spatiotemporal resolution by switching illumination and detection between two perpendicular objectives in an alternating duty cycle. Computationally fusing the resulting volumetric views provides an isotropic resolution of 330 nm. As the sample is stationary and only two views are required, we achieve an imaging speed of 200 images/s (i.e., 0.5 s for a 50-plane volume). Unlike spinning-disk confocal or Bessel beam methods, which illuminate the sample outside the focal plane, we maintain high spatiotemporal resolution over hundreds of volumes with negligible photobleaching. To illustrate the ability of our method to study biological systems that require high-speed volumetric visualization and/or low photobleaching, we describe microtubule tracking in live cells, nuclear imaging over 14 h during nematode embryogenesis and imaging of neural wiring during Caenorhabditis elegans brain development over 5 h.},

  ABSTRACT = {Super-resolved structured illumination microscopy (SR-SIM) is an important tool for fluorescence microscopy. SR-SIM microscopes perform multiple image acquisitions with varying illumination patterns, and reconstruct them to a super-resolved image. In its most frequent, linear implementation, SR-SIM doubles the spatial resolution. The reconstruction is performed numerically on the acquired wide-field image data, and thus relies on a software implementation of specific SR-SIM image reconstruction algorithms. We present fairSIM, an easy-to-use plugin that provides SR-SIM reconstructions for a wide range of SR-SIM platforms directly within ImageJ. For research groups developing their own implementations of super-resolution structured illumination microscopy, fairSIM takes away the hurdle of generating yet another implementation of the reconstruction algorithm. For users of commercial microscopes, it offers an additional, in-depth analysis option for their data independent of specific operating systems. As a modular, open-source solution, fairSIM can easily be adapted, automated and extended as the field of SR-SIM progresses.},

  ABSTRACT = {We demonstrate three-dimensional (3D) super-resolution in live multicellular organisms using structured illumination microscopy (SIM). Sparse multifocal illumination patterns generated by a digital micromirror device (DMD) allowed us to physically reject out-of-focus light, enabling 3D subdiffractive imaging in samples eightfold thicker than had been previously imaged with SIM. We imaged samples at one 2D image per second, at resolutions as low as 145 nm laterally and 400 nm axially. In addition to dual-labeled, whole fixed cells, we imaged GFP-labeled microtubules in live transgenic zebrafish embryos at depths {$>$}45 μm. We captured dynamic changes in the zebrafish lateral line primordium and observed interactions between myosin IIA and F-actin in cells encapsulated in collagen gels, obtaining two-color 4D super-resolution data sets spanning tens of time points and minutes without apparent phototoxicity. Our method uses commercially available parts and open-source software and is simpler than existing SIM implementations, allowing easy integration with wide-field microscopes.},

@ARTICLE{bainesHerpesSimplexVirus2011,
  ABSTRACT = {Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is an important pathogenic agent that causes recurrent oral and genital lesions, blindness and encephalitis. It is a member of the family Herpesviridae, which contains three subfamilies (alpha- beta- and gammaherpesvirinae) whose members infect humans to cause a variety of ailments, from benign rashes to nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although this review focuses on HSV, the assembly steps that occur in the nucleus and the proteins involved are highly conserved among all family members, which suggests that antiviral agents that block these steps might be effective against many different herpesviruses and their associated diseases. Despite this potential, a broadly effective compound has yet to be realized, in part because many of the processes are only poorly understood in sufficient molecular detail. The goal of this review is to outline these intranuclear assembly steps and illustrate potential and existing antiviral strategies that exploit them.},

  ABSTRACT = {Human herpesviruses may cause infections of the central nervous system during primary infection or following reactivation from a latent state. Especially in immunosuppressed patients the infection can take a life-threatening course, and therefore early diagnosis of herpesvirus-associated neurological diseases should have high priority. Clinical presentation in these patients is usually without typical features, making diagnosis even more challenging. Therefore general broad testing for different herpesviruses in cerebrospinal fluid samples is highly recommended. In addition, determination of the virus DNA level in the cerebrospinal fluid by quantitative assays seems to be of high importance to determine prognosis. Moreover, it might help to differentiate between specific virus-associated disease and unspecific presence of virus in the cerebrospinal fluid, especially in immunocompromised patients. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of cerebrospinal fluid has revolutionized the diagnosis of nervous system viral infections, particularly those caused by human herpesviruses. This review summarizes the role human herpesviruses play in central nervous system infections in immunocompromised patients, with a focus on the clinical manifestation of encephalitis.},

@ARTICLE{betzigImagingIntracellularFluorescent2006,
  ABSTRACT = {We introduce a method for optically imaging intracellular proteins at nanometer spatial resolution. Numerous sparse subsets of photoactivatable fluorescent protein molecules were activated, localized (to ∼2 to 25 nanometers), and then bleached. The aggregate position information from all subsets was then assembled into a superresolution image. We used this method—termed photoactivated localization microscopy—to image specific target proteins in thin sections of lysosomes and mitochondria; in fixed whole cells, we imaged vinculin at focal adhesions, actin within a lamellipodium, and the distribution of the retroviral protein Gag at the plasma membrane. Proteins of interest can be labeled with fluorescent tags and located by photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) in thin sections and fixed cells at near-molecular resolution.

@ARTICLE{bairdFrontalLobeActivation2002,
  ABSTRACT = {The ability to create and hold a mental schema of an object is one of the milestones in cognitive development. Developmental scientists have named the behavioral manifestation of this competence object permanence. Convergent evidence indicates that frontal lobe maturation plays a critical role in the display of object permanence, but methodological and ethical constrains have made it difficult to collect neurophysiological evidence from awake, behaving infants. Near-infrared spectroscopy provides a noninvasive assessment of changes in oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin and total hemoglobin concentration within a prescribed region. The evidence described in this report reveals that the emergence of object permanence is related to an increase in hemoglobin concentration in frontal cortex.},

  ABSTRACT = {The God of Thunder returns in the New York Times Bestseller – Now in paperback and hotter than hell! * More insight from the Demon – Including the making of Destroyer and the truth behind the greatest rock band in the world * Look for all four special collector's covers * And more photos You wanted the truth, you got the truth—the hottest book in the world! Fueled by an explosive mix of makeup, costumes, and attitude, KISS burst onto the music scene thirty years ago and has become a rock institution. The band has sold more than eighty million records, has broken every concert attendance record set by Elvis Presley and the Beatles, stands behind the Beatles alone in number of gold records from any group in history, and has spawned more than 2,500 licenses. There would have been no KISS without Gene Simmons, the outrageous star whose superlong tongue, legendary sexual exploits, and demonic makeup have made him a rock icon. KISS and Make-Up is the wild, shocking, unbelievable story, from the man himself, about how an immigrant boy from Israel studied to be a rabbi, was saved by rock and roll, and became one of the most notorious rock stars the world has ever seen. Before Gene Simmons there was Chaim Witz, a boy from Haifa, Israel, who had no inkling of the life that lay ahead of him. In vivid detail Gene recounts his childhood growing up in Haifa under the watchful eye of his beloved, strong-willed mother, a concentration camp surviv∨ his adolescent years attending a Jewish theological center for rabbinical studies in Brooklyn; his love of all things American, including comic books, superheroes, and cowboys; and his early fascination with girls and sex, which prompted him to start a rock band in school after he saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. KISS and Make-Up is not just the classic story of achieving the American dream through the eyes of an immigrant boy making good, but a juicy, rollicking rock and roll read that takes you along for the ride of your life with KISS, from the 1970s, when they were the biggest band in the world, through the ’80s, when they took off their world-famous war paint, and into the ’90s, when they came back bigger and badder than ever to become the number one touring band in the world. In his own irreverent, unapologetic voice, Gene talks about the girls (4,600 of them and counting); his tight bond with KISS cofounder Paul Stanley; the struggles he and Paul had with Ace Frehley and Peter Criss and their departures from the group; the new band members and Eric Carr’s untimely death; the enormous love and affection he has for the people who put him there in the first place—the KISS Army and the ever-loyal KISS fans around the world; his love life, including stories about his relationships with Cher and Diana Ross and with Shannon Tweed, Playmate of the Year, mother of his son and daughter, and his companion of eighteen years; and much more. Full of dozens of photographs, many never-before-seen pictures from Gene’s private collection, KISS and Make-Up is a surprising, intimate look at the man behind the mask. For the first time Gene reveals all the facets of his complex personality—son, rock star, actor, record producer, businessman, ladies’ man, devoted father, and now author.},

@ARTICLE{bauschMeasurementLocalViscoelasticity1999,
  ABSTRACT = {We measured the viscoelastic properties of the cytoplasm of J774 macrophages with a recently developed microrheometer. Ferromagnetic beads (1.3 microm in diameter) were used to determine the local viscoelastic moduli. Step-force pulses were applied to the magnetic beads and the displacement was observed by single particle tracking. By analyzing the creep response curves in terms of a triphasic mechanical equivalent circuit, we measured the shear elastic modulus, the effective viscosities, and the strain relaxation time. The values of the shear modulus vary by more than an order of magnitude within the cell population (range, 20-735 Pa; average, 343 Pa) and by a factor of 2 within single cells. The effective viscosity of the cytoplasm exhibits a relatively sharp distribution about an average of eta = 210 Pa s (+/- 143 Pa s). We measured the displacement field generated by the local forces by observing the induced motion of nonmagnetic beads. Even at distances of the order of 1 microm, no induced motion was seen, suggesting that the cytoplasm is composed of clusters of densely packed and cross-linked filaments separated by soft regions. In another series of experiments we analyzed the magnetophoretic motion of the ferromagnetic beads at a constant magnetic force. Measuring the bead velocity parallel and perpendicular to the applied force showed that local active forces on the beads varied from 50 to 900 pN.},

@REPORT{vicci3DMagneticForce2003,
  ABSTRACT = {A potentially useful instrument for the biological sciences would be a 3 dimensional force microscope (3DFM) for measurement of 3 dimensional viscous and elastic fields at sub micrometer scale in-vitro and in-vivo. Substantial development has been conducted on various aspects of this problem, but a general instrument having this capability does not yet exist. All approaches I know of utilize a microscopic bead as a mechanical probe, the position of which can be sensed, and the force on which can be controlled. One force technique is “optical tweezers.” This technique requires high optical field intensities which interact strongly with many materials and may produce undesired side effects on in-vivo experiments. Alternatively, magnetic techniques use a magnetic bead driven by low frequency magnetic fields which only interact weakly with most biological materials. Related prior work includes high gradient techniques [Haber00], a close proximity single pole rheometer [Bausch98,99], and a two dimensional manipulator [Amblard96]. To my knowledge, our work is the first attempt to implement a full three dimensional magnetic manipulator. A low frequency (DC) prototype magnetic circuit and drive electronics have been designed and built to explore the capabilities of the magnetic technique for a 3DFM. This report comprises a brief description of the DC prototype, and a complete set of its design documents. This is a report of work in progress, and does not present any results of experiments performed on the prototype.},

@ARTICLE{overbyNovelDynamicRheological2005,
  ABSTRACT = {The rheology of cells and sub-cellular structures, such as focal adhesions, are important for cell form and function. Here we describe electromagnetic pulling cytometry (EPC), a technique to analyze cell rheology by applying dynamic tensional forces to ligand-coated magnetic microbeads bound to cell surface integrin receptors. EPC utilizes an electromagnetic microneedle that is integrated with a computerized control and image acquisition system and an inverted microscope and CCD camera to monitor bead displacement. Arbitrary force regimens may be defined over a wide range of frequency (DC to 10 Hz) and force (100 pN to 10 nN). With EPC, the viscoelastic creep response of individual focal adhesions was measured over three decades in time using RGD-coated magnetic microbeads bound to integrins that induce local focal adhesion assembly and coupling to the internal cytoskeleton. These data were compared to the power-law-like predictions from the soft glassy model of cell rheology proposed by Fabry et al. Although power-law-like behavior was observed in some focal adhesions, 52\% of these structures did not exhibit power-law-like behavior, but instead exhibited either a multi-phase response characterized by abrupt changes in slope or experienced a retraction in the opposite direction to the applied force, especially in response to prolonged force application. These data suggest that while the soft glassy model may provide reasonable estimates for aggregate mechanical behavior of living cells, the rheological behavior of individual focal adhesions may be more heterogeneous and complex than suggested by the soft glassy model. These results are considered in context with the hierarchical nature of cytoskeletal architecture.},

@ARTICLE{maitreAdhesionFunctionsCell2012,
  ABSTRACT = {Differential cell adhesion and cortex tension are thought to drive cell sorting by controlling cell-cell contact formation. Here, we show that cell adhesion and cortex tension have different mechanical functions in controlling progenitor cell-cell contact formation and sorting during zebrafish gastrulation. Cortex tension controls cell-cell contact expansion by modulating interfacial tension at the contact. By contrast, adhesion has little direct function in contact expansion, but instead is needed to mechanically couple the cortices of adhering cells at their contacts, allowing cortex tension to control contact expansion. The coupling function of adhesion is mediated by E-cadherin and limited by the mechanical anchoring of E-cadherin to the cortex. Thus, cell adhesion provides the mechanical scaffold for cell cortex tension to drive cell sorting during gastrulation.},

  ABSTRACT = {We report here the development of a three-dimensional (3D) magnetic force microscope for applying forces to and measuring responses of biological systems and materials. This instrument combines a conventional optical microscope with a free-floating or specifically bound magnetic bead used as a mechanical probe. Forces can be applied by the bead to microscopic structures of interest (specimens), while the reaction displacement of the bead is measured. This enables 3D mechanical manipulations and measurements to be performed on specimens in fluids. Force is generated by the magnetically permeable bead in reaction to fields produced by external electromagnets. The displacement is measured by interferometry using forward light scattered by the bead from a focused laser beam. The far-field interference pattern is imaged on a quadrant photodetector from which the 3D displacement can be computed over a limited range about the focal point. The bead and specimen are mounted on a 3D translation stage and feedback techniques are used to keep the bead within this limited range. We demonstrate the system with application to beads attached to cilia in human lung cell cultures.},

  ABSTRACT = {During development, mechanical forces cause changes in size, shape, number, position, and gene expression of cells. They are therefore integral to any morphogenetic processes. Force generation by actin-myosin networks and force transmission through adhesive complexes are two self-organizing phenomena driving tissue morphogenesis. Coordination and integration of forces by long-range force transmission and mechanosensing of cells within tissues produce large-scale tissue shape changes. Extrinsic mechanical forces also control tissue patterning by modulating cell fate specification and differentiation. Thus, the interplay between tissue mechanics and biochemical signaling orchestrates tissue morphogenesis and patterning in development.},

  ABSTRACT = {BACKGROUND: Epithelial junctional networks assume packing geometries characterized by different cell shapes, neighbor number distributions and areas. The development of specific packing geometries is tightly controlled; in the Drosophila wing epithelium, cells convert from an irregular to a hexagonal array shortly before hair formation. Packing geometry is determined by developmental mechanisms that likely control the biophysical properties of cells and their interactions. RESULTS: To understand how physical cellular properties and proliferation determine cell-packing geometries, we use a vertex model for the epithelial junctional network in which cell packing geometries correspond to stable and stationary network configurations. The model takes into account cell elasticity and junctional forces arising from cortical contractility and adhesion. By numerically simulating proliferation, we generate different network morphologies that depend on physical parameters. These networks differ in polygon class distribution, cell area variation, and the rate of T1 and T2 transitions during growth. Comparing theoretical results to observed cell morphologies reveals regions of parameter space where calculated network morphologies match observed ones. We independently estimate parameter values by quantifying network deformations caused by laser ablating individual cell boundaries. CONCLUSIONS: The vertex model accounts qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed packing geometry in the wing disc and its response to perturbation by laser ablation. Epithelial packing geometry is a consequence of both physical cellular properties and the disordering influence of proliferation. The occurrence of T2 transitions during network growth suggests that elimination of cells from the proliferating disc epithelium may be the result of junctional force balances.},

  ABSTRACT = {Embryonic morphogenesis requires the execution of complex mechanisms that regulate the local behaviour of groups of cells. The orchestration of such mechanisms has been mainly deciphered through the identification of conserved families of signalling pathways that spatially and temporally control cell behaviour. However, how this information is processed to control cell shape and cell dynamics is an open area of investigation. The framework that emerges from diverse disciplines such as cell biology, physics and developmental biology points to adhesion and cortical actin networks as regulators of cell surface mechanics. In this context, a range of developmental phenomena can be explained by the regulation of cell surface tension.},

@ARTICLE{maitreAsymmetricDivisionContractile2016,
  ABSTRACT = {During pre-implantation development, the mammalian embryo self-organizes into the blastocyst, which consists of an epithelial layer encapsulating the inner-cell mass (ICM) giving rise to all embryonic tissues. In mice, oriented cell division, apicobasal polarity and actomyosin contractility are thought to contribute to the formation of the ICM. However, how these processes work together remains unclear. Here we show that asymmetric segregation of the apical domain generates blastomeres with different contractilities, which triggers their sorting into inner and outer positions. Three-dimensional physical modelling of embryo morphogenesis reveals that cells internalize only when differences in surface contractility exceed a predictable threshold. We validate this prediction using biophysical measurements, and successfully redirect cell sorting within the developing blastocyst using maternal myosin (Myh9)-knockout chimaeric embryos. Finally, we find that loss of contractility causes blastomeres to show ICM-like markers, regardless of their position. In particular, contractility controls Yap subcellular localization, raising the possibility that mechanosensing occurs during blastocyst lineage specification. We conclude that contractility couples the positioning and fate specification of blastomeres. We propose that this ensures the robust self-organization of blastomeres into the blastocyst, which confers remarkable regulative capacities to mammalian embryos.},

@ARTICLE{kaneZebrafishMidblastulaTransition1993a,
  ABSTRACT = {The zebrafish midblastula transition (MBT) begins at cycle 10. It is characterized by cell cycle lengthening, loss of cell synchrony, activation of transcription and appearance of cell motility. Superceding a 15 minute oscillator that controls the first nine cycles, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio appears to govern the MBT. This timing mechanism operates cell autonomously: clones of labeled cells initiate cell cycle lengthening independently of neighbors but dependent on immediate lineal ancestors. Unequal divisions, when they occur, produce asymmetric cell cycle lengthening based on the volume of each daughter. During the several cycles after the MBT begins, cycle length is correlated with the reciprocal of the blastomere volume, suggesting a continuation of cell cycle regulation by the nucleocytoplasmic ratio during an interval that we term the 'MBT period'.},

  ABSTRACT = {During nervous system development, neurons extend axons along well-defined pathways. The current understanding of axon pathfinding is based mainly on chemical signaling. However, growing neurons interact not only chemically but also mechanically with their environment. Here we identify mechanical signals as important regulators of axon pathfinding. In vitro, substrate stiffness determined growth patterns of Xenopus retinal ganglion cell axons. In vivo atomic force microscopy revealed a noticeable pattern of stiffness gradients in the embryonic brain. Retinal ganglion cell axons grew toward softer tissue, which was reproduced in vitro in the absence of chemical gradients. To test the importance of mechanical signals for axon growth in vivo, we altered brain stiffness, blocked mechanotransduction pharmacologically and knocked down the mechanosensitive ion channel piezo1. All treatments resulted in aberrant axonal growth and pathfinding errors, suggesting that local tissue stiffness, read out by mechanosensitive ion channels, is critically involved in instructing neuronal growth in vivo.},

@INCOLLECTION{AlgorithmsReconstructionNondiffracting2001,
  ABSTRACT = {In this chapter we will deal with the mathematical basis of tomography with nondiffracting sources. We will show how one can go about recovering the image of the cross section of an object from the projection data. In ideal situations, projections are a set of measurements of the integrated values of some parameter of the object—integrations being along straight lines through the object and being referred to as line integrals. We will show that the key to tomographic imaging is the Fourier Slice Theorem which relates the measured projection data to the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the object cross section. This chapter will start with the definition of line integrals and how they are combined to form projections of an object. By finding the Fourier transform of a projection taken along parallel lines, we will then derive the Fourier Slice Theorem. The reconstruction algorithm used depends on the type of projection data measured; we will discuss algorithms based on parallel beam projection data and two types of fan beam data. 3.1 Line Integrals and Projections A line integral, as the name implies, represents the integral of some parameter of the object along a line. In this chapter we will not concern ourselves with the physical phenomena that generate line integrals, but a typical example is the attenuation of x-rays as they propagate through biological tissue. In this case the object is modeled as a two-dimensional (or three-dimensional) distribution of the x-ray attenuation constant and a line integral represents the total attenuation suffered by a beam of x-rays as it travels in a straight line through the object. More details of this process and other examples will be presented in Chapter 4. We will use the coordinate system defined in Fig. 3.1 to describe line integrals and projections. In this example the object is represented by a two-dimensional function ƒ (x, y) and each line integral by the (θ, t) parameters.},

@BOOK{kakPrinciplesComputerizedTomographic2001,
  ABSTRACT = {The purpose of this book is to provide a tutorial overview on the subject of computerized tomographic imaging. We expect the book to be useful for practicing engineers and scientists for gaining an understanding of what can and cannot be done with tomographic imaging. Toward this end, we have tried to strike a balance among purely algorithmic issues, topics dealing with how to generate data for reconstruction in different domains, and artifacts inherent to different data collection strategies. Our hope is that the style of presentation used will also make the book useful for a beginning graduate course on the subject. The desired prerequisites for taking such a course will depend upon the aims of the instructor. If the instructor wishes to teach the course primarily at a theoretical level, with not much emphasis on computer implementations of the reconstruction algorithms, the book is mostly self-contained for graduate students in engineering, the sciences, and mathematics. On the other hand, if the instructor wishes to impart proficiency in the implementations, it would be desirable for the students to have had some prior experience with writing computer programs for digital signal or image processing. The introductory material we have included in Chapter 2 should help the reader review the relevant practical details in digital signal and image processing. There are no homework problems in the book, the reason being that in our own lecturing on the subject, we have tended to emphasize the implementation aspects and, therefore, the homework has consisted of writing computer programs for reconstruction algorithms. The lists of references by no means constitute a complete bibliography on the subject. Basically, we have included those references that we have found useful in our own research over the years. Whenever possible, we have referenced books and review articles to provide the reader with entry points for more exhaustive literature citations. Except in isolated cases, we have not made any attempts to establish historical priorities. No value judgments should be implied by our including or excluding a particular work. Many of our friends and colleagues deserve much credit for helping bring this book to fruition. This book draws heavily from research done at Purdue by our past and present colleagues and collaborators: Carl Crawford, Mani Azimi, David Nahamoo, Anders Andersen, S. X. Pan, Kris Dines, and Barry Roberts.},

  ABSTRACT = {Human herpesviruses may cause infections of the central nervous system during primary infection or following reactivation from a latent state. Especially in immunosuppressed patients the infection can take a life-threatening course, and therefore early diagnosis of herpesvirus-associated neurological diseases should have high priority. Clinical presentation in these patients is usually without typical features, making diagnosis even more challenging. Therefore general broad testing for different herpesviruses in cerebrospinal fluid samples is highly recommended. In addition, determination of the virus DNA level in the cerebrospinal fluid by quantitative assays seems to be of high importance to determine prognosis. Moreover, it might help to differentiate between specific virus-associated disease and unspecific presence of virus in the cerebrospinal fluid, especially in immunocompromised patients. Polymerase chain reaction analysis of cerebrospinal fluid has revolutionized the diagnosis of nervous system viral infections, particularly those caused by human herpesviruses. This review summarizes the role human herpesviruses play in central nervous system infections in immunocompromised patients, with a focus on the clinical manifestation of encephalitis.},

@ARTICLE{mettenleiterWayOutWhat2013,
  ABSTRACT = {Herpesvirus capsids are assembled in the nucleus of infected cells whereas final maturation occurs in the cytosol. To access the final maturation compartment, intranuclear capsids have to cross the nuclear envelope which represents a formidable barrier. They do so by budding at the inner nuclear membrane, thereby forming a primary enveloped particle residing in the perinuclear cleft. Formation of primary envelopes is driven by a heterodimeric complex of two conserved herpesviral proteins, designated in the herpes simplex virus nomenclature as pUL34, a tail-anchored transmembrane protein located in the nuclear envelope, and pUL31. This nuclear egress complex recruits viral and cellular kinases to soften the nuclear lamina and allowing access of capsids to the inner nuclear membrane. How capsids are recruited to the budding site and into the primary virus particle is still not completely understood, nor is the composition of the primary enveloped virion in the perinuclear cleft. Fusion of the primary envelope with the outer nuclear membrane then results in translocation of the capsid to the cytosol. This fusion event is clearly different from fusion during infectious entry of free virions into target cells in that it does not require the conserved essential core herpesvirus fusion machinery. Nuclear egress can thus be viewed as a vesicle (primary envelope)-mediated transport of cargo (capsids) through thenuclear envelope, a process which had been unique in cell biology. Only recently has a similar process been identified in Drosophila for nuclear egress of large ribonucleoprotein complexes. Thus, herpesviruses appear to subvert a hitherto cryptic cellular pathway for translocation of capsids from the nucleus to the cytosol.},

It is a member of the family Herpesviridae, which contains three subfamilies (alpha- beta- and gammaherpesvirinae) whose members infect humans to cause a variety of ailments, from benign rashes to nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Although this review focuses on HSV, the assembly steps that occur in the nucleus and the proteins involved are highly conserved among all family members, which suggests that antiviral agents that block these steps might be effective against many different herpesviruses and their associated diseases. Despite this potential, a broadly effective compound has yet to be realized, in part because many of the processes are only poorly understood in sufficient molecular detail. The goal of this review is to outline these intranuclear assembly steps and illustrate potential and existing antiviral strategies that exploit them.},

Tegument occupies the space between the nucleocapsid (capsid containing DNA core) and the envelope. A combination of genetic, biochemical and proteomic analysis of alphaherpes virions suggest the tegument contains in the order of 20 viral proteins. Historically the tegument has been described as amorphous but increasing evidence suggests there is an ordered addition of tegument during assembly. This review highlights the diverse roles, in addition to structural, that tegument plays during herpes viral replication using as an example herpes simplex virus type 1. Such diverse roles include: capsid transport during entry and egress; targeting of the capsid to the nucleus; regulation of transcription, translation and apoptosis; DNA replication; immune modulation; cytoskeletal assembly; nuclear egress of capsid; and viral assembly and final egress.},

Recent advances in mass spectrometry methods coupled with the development of proteomic approaches have greatly facilitated the detection of virion components, protein interactions in infected cells, and virally induced changes in the cellular proteome, resulting in a more comprehensive understanding of viral infection. In addition, a rapidly increasing number of high-resolution structures for viral proteins have provided valuable information on the mechanism of action of these proteins as well as aided in the design and understanding of specific inhibitors that could be used in antiviral therapies. In this paper, we discuss proteomic studies conducted on all eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages, covering virion composition, viral protein structures, virus-virus and virus-host protein interactions, and changes in the cellular proteome upon viral infection.},

  ABSTRACT = {Herpes Simplex Virus-1 is a common infectious agent, but the precise detail of entry and infection of cells has only now begun to be clarified. Four viral surface glycoproteins (gB, gD, gH and gL) are required. This review summarises the known structure and function of each of these essential viral envelope glycoproteins, and explores what is known about their close cooperation with each other in mediating cellular membrane fusion. It is suggested that, following gD binding to one of its entry receptors, membrane fusion is mediated by gB and the heterodimer gH/gL. Significantly, these four entry glycoproteins also play a key role in the interaction between HSV and the host immune system. The glycoproteins serve an important role as targets of adaptive immunity. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the same proteins also play a key role in initiating the early innate immune response to HSV. Understanding the complex functions of these HSV proteins may be essential for successful development of vaccines for HSV.},

Viral particles of neurotropic alphaherpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1) show bidirectional transport towards the cell center as well as the periphery, indicating that they utilize microtubule motors of opposing directionality. To understand the mechanisms of specific motor recruitment, it is necessary to characterize the molecular composition of such motile viral structures. We have generated HSV1 capsids with different surface features without impairing their overall architecture, and show that in a mammalian cell-free system the microtubule motors dynein and kinesin-1 and the dynein cofactor dynactin could interact directly with capsids independent of other host factors. The capsid composition and surface was analyzed with respect to 23 structural proteins that are potentially exposed to the cytosol during virus assembly or cell entry. Many of these proteins belong to the tegument, the hallmark of all herpesviruses located between the capsid and the viral envelope. Using immunoblots, quantitative mass spectrometry and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy, we show that capsids exposing inner tegument proteins such as pUS3, pUL36, pUL37, ICP0, pUL14, pUL16, and pUL21 recruited dynein, dynactin, kinesin-1 and kinesin-2. In contrast, neither untegumented capsids exposing VP5, VP26, pUL17 and pUL25 nor capsids covered by outer tegument proteins such as vhs, pUL11, ICP4, ICP34.5, VP11/12, VP13/14, VP16, VP22 or pUS11 bound microtubule motors. Our data suggest that HSV1 uses different structural features of the inner tegument to recruit dynein or kinesin-1. Individual capsids simultaneously accommodated motors of opposing directionality as well as several copies of the same motor. Thus, these associated motors either engage in a tug-of-war or their activities are coordinately regulated to achieve net transport either to the nucleus during cell entry or to cytoplasmic membranes for envelopment during assembly.},

  ABSTRACT = {Herpes simplex virus 1 fuses with the plasma membrane of a host cell, and the incoming capsids are efficiently and rapidly transported across the cytosol to the nuclear pore complexes, where the viral DNA genomes are released into the nucleoplasm. Using biochemical assays, immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy in the presence and absence of microtubule depolymerizing agents, it was shown that the cytosolic capsid transport in Vero cells was mediated by microtubules. Antibody labeling revealed the attachment of dynein, a minus end–directed, microtubule-dependent motor, to the viral capsids. We propose that the incoming capsids bind to microtubules and use dynein to propel them from the cell periphery to the nucleus.},

  ABSTRACT = {During entry, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) releases its capsid and the tegument proteins into the cytosol of a host cell by fusing with the plasma membrane. The capsid is then transported to the nucleus, where it docks at the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), and the viral genome is rapidly released into the nucleoplasm. In this study, capsid association with NPCs and uncoating of the viral DNA were reconstituted in vitro. Isolated capsids prepared from virus were incubated with cytosol and purified nuclei. They were found to bind to the nuclear pores. Binding could be inhibited by pretreating the nuclei with wheat germ agglutinin, anti-NPC antibodies, or antibodies against importin beta. Furthermore, in the absence of cytosol, purified importin beta was both sufficient and necessary to support efficient capsid binding to nuclei. Up to 60 to 70\% of capsids interacting with rat liver nuclei in vitro released their DNA if cytosol and metabolic energy were supplied. Interaction of the capsid with the nuclear pore thus seemed to trigger the release of the viral genome, implying that components of the NPC play an active role in the nuclear events during HSV-1 entry into host cells.},

  ABSTRACT = {Herpes simplex virus (HSV) nucleocapsids acquire an envelope by budding through the inner nuclear membrane, but it is uncertain whether this envelope is retained during virus maturation and egress or whether mature progeny virions are derived by deenvelopment at the outer nuclear membrane followed by reenvelopment in a cytoplasmic compartment. To resolve this issue, we used immunogold electron microscopy to examine the distribution of glycoprotein D (gD) in cells infected with HSV-1 encoding a wild-type gD or a gD which is retrieved to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In cells infected with wild-type HSV-1, extracellular virions and virions in the perinuclear space bound approximately equal amounts of gD antibody. In cells infected with HSV-1 encoding an ER-retrieved gD, the inner and outer nuclear membranes were heavily gold labeled, as were perinuclear enveloped virions. Extracellular virions exhibited very little gold decoration (10- to 30-fold less than perinuclear virions). We conclude that the envelope of perinuclear virions must be lost during maturation and egress and that mature progeny virions must acquire an envelope from a post-ER cytoplasmic compartment. We noted also that gD appears to be excluded from the plasma membrane in cells infected with wild-type virus.},

@ARTICLE{mcmillanCytoplasmicDomainHerpes2001,
  ABSTRACT = {Alphaherpesviruses express a heterodimeric glycoprotein, gE/gI, that facilitates cell-to-cell spread between epithelial cells and neurons. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) gE/gI accumulates at junctions formed between polarized epithelial cells at late times of infection. However, at earlier times after HSV infection, or when gE/gI is expressed using virus vectors, the glycoprotein localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The cytoplasmic (CT) domains of gE and gI contain numerous TGN and endosomal sorting motifs and are essential for epithelial cell-to-cell spread. Here, we swapped the CT domains of HSV gE and gI onto another HSV glycoprotein, gD. When the gD-gI(CT) chimeric protein was expressed using a replication-defective adenovirus (Ad) vector, the protein was found on both the apical and basolateral surfaces of epithelial cells, as was gD. By contrast, the gD-gE(CT) chimeric protein, gE/gI, and gE, when expressed by using Ad vectors, localized exclusively to the TGN. However, gD-gE(CT), gE/gI, and TGN46, a cellular TGN protein, became redistributed largely to lateral surfaces and cell junctions during intermediate to late stages of HSV infection. Strikingly, gE and TGN46 remained sequestered in the TGN when cells were infected with a gI(-)HSV mutant. The redistribution of gE/gI to lateral cell surfaces did not involve widespread HSV inhibition of endocytosis because the transferrin receptor and gE were both internalized from the cell surface. Thus, gE/gI accumulates in the TGN in early phases of HSV infection then moves to lateral surfaces, to cell junctions, at late stages of infection, coincident with the redistribution of a TGN marker. These results are related to recent observations that gE/gI participates in the envelopment of nucleocapsids into cytoplasmic vesicles (A. R. Brack, B. G. Klupp, H. Granzow, R. Tirabassi, L. W. Enquist, and T. C. Mettenleiter, J. Virol. 74:4004-4016, 2000) and that gE/gI can sort nascent virions from cytoplasmic vesicles specifically to the lateral surfaces of epithelial cells (D. C. Johnson, M. Webb, T. W. Wisner, and C. Brunetti, J. Virol. 75:821-833, 2000). Therefore, gE/gI localizes to the TGN, through interactions between the CT domain of gE and cellular sorting machinery, and then participates in envelopment of cytosolic nucleocapsids there. Nascent virions are then sorted from the TGN to cell junctions.},

  ABSTRACT = {Egress of herpes capsids from the nucleus to the plasma membrane is a complex multistep transport event that is poorly understood. The current model proposes an initial envelopment at the inner nuclear membrane of capsids newly assembled in the nucleus. The capsids are then released in cytosol by fusion with the outer nuclear membrane. They are finally reenveloped at a downstream organelle before traveling to the plasma membrane for their extracellular release. Although the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is often cited as a potential site of reenvelopment, other organelles have also been proposed, including the Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment, aggresomes, tegusomes, and early or late endosomes. To clarify this important issue, we followed herpes simplex virus type 1 egress by immunofluorescence under conditions that slowed intracellular transport and promoted the accumulation of the otherwise transient reenvelopment intermediate. The data show that the capsids transit by the TGN and point to this compartment as the main reenvelopment site, although a contribution by endosomes cannot formally be excluded. Given that viral glycoproteins are expected to accumulate where capsids acquire their envelope, we examined this prediction and found that all tested could indeed be detected at the TGN. Moreover, this accumulation occurred independently of capsid egress. Surprisingly, capsids were often found immediately adjacent to the viral glycoproteins at the TGN.},

  ABSTRACT = {Axonal transport of herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) is essential for viral infection and spread in the peripheral nervous system of the host. Therefore, the virus probably utilizes existing active transport and targeting mechanisms in neurons for virus assembly and spread from neurons to skin. In the present study, we used transmission immunoelectron microscopy to investigate the nature and origin of vesicles involved in the anterograde axonal transport of HSV-1 tegument and envelope proteins and of vesicles surrounding partially and fully enveloped capsids in growth cones. This study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of virus assembly and exit from axons of human fetal dorsal root ganglia neurons. We demonstrated that viral tegument and envelope proteins can travel in axons independently of viral capsids and were transported to the axon terminus in two types of transport vesicles, tubulovesicular membrane structures and large dense-cored vesicles. These vesicles and membrane carriers were derived from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and contained key proteins, such as Rab3A, SNAP-25, GAP-43, and kinesin-1, involved in the secretory and exocytic pathways in axons. These proteins were also observed on fully and partially enveloped capsids in growth cones and on extracellular virions. Our findings provide further evidence to the subassembly model of separate transport in axons of unenveloped capsids from envelope and tegument proteins with final virus assembly occurring at the axon terminus. We postulate that HSV-1 capsids invaginate tegument- and envelope-bearing TGN-derived vesicles and utilize the large secretory vesicle pathway of exocytosis for exit from axons.},

  ABSTRACT = {Egress of newly assembled herpesvirus particles from infected cells is a highly dynamic process involving the host secretory pathway working in concert with viral components. To elucidate the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress, we developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to visualize the final transport and exocytosis of pseudorabies virus (PRV) particles in non-polarized epithelial cells. This method is based on total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to selectively image fluorescent virus particles near the plasma membrane, and takes advantage of a virus-encoded pH-sensitive probe to visualize the precise moment and location of particle exocytosis. We performed single-particle tracking and mean squared displacement analysis to characterize particle motion, and imaged a panel of cellular proteins to identify those spatially and dynamically associated with viral exocytosis. Based on our data, individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles. Rab GTPases, Rab6a, Rab8a, and Rab11a, key regulators of the plasma membrane-directed secretory pathway, are present on the virus secretory vesicle. These vesicles undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis, which is most frequently near patches of LL5β, part of a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. Vesicles are tightly docked at the site of exocytosis for several seconds, and membrane fusion occurs, displacing the virion a small distance across the plasma membrane. After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. Based on recent reports in the cell biological and alpha herpesvirus literature, combined with our spatial and dynamic data on viral egress, we propose an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress.},

  ABSTRACT = {As the inner tegument proteins pUL36 and pUL37 of alphaherpesviruses may contribute to efficient intracellular transport of viral particles, we investigated their role in cytosolic capsid motility during assembly of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1). As reported previously for pUL36, untagged pUL37 and UL37GFP bound to cytosolic capsids before these acquired outer tegument and envelope proteins. Capsids tagged with CheVP26 analysed by live cell imaging were capable of directed long-distance cytoplasmic transport during the assembly of wild-type virions, while capsids of the HSV1-ΔUL37 or HSV1-ΔUL36 deletion mutants showed only random, undirected motion. The HSV1-ΔUL37 phenotype was restored when UL37GFP had been overexpressed prior to infection. Quantitative immunoelectron microscopy revealed that capsids of HSV1-ΔUL37 still recruited pUL36, whereas pUL37 did not colocalize with capsids of HSV1-ΔUL36. Nevertheless, the cytosolic capsids of neither mutant could undergo secondary envelopment. Our data suggest that pUL36 and pUL37 are important prior to their functions in linking the inner to the outer tegument. Efficient capsid transport to the organelle of secondary envelopment requires recruitment ofpUL37 onto capsids, most likely via its interaction with pUL36, while capsid-associated pUL36 alone is insufficient.},

  ABSTRACT = {We report a method for tracking individual quantum dot (QD) labeled proteins inside of live cells that uses four overlapping confocal volume elements and active feedback once every 5 milliseconds to follow three dimensional molecular motion. This method has substantial advantages over 3D molecular tracking methods based upon CCD cameras, including increased Z tracking range (10 μm demonstrated here), substantially lower excitation powers (15 μW used here), and the ability to perform time-resolved spectroscopy (such as fluorescence lifetime measurements or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy) on the molecules being tracked. In particular, we show for the first time fluorescence photon anti-bunching of individual QD labeled proteins in live cells and demonstrate the ability to track individual dye labeled nucleotides (Cy5-dUTP) at biologically relevant transport rates. To demonstrate the power of these methods for exploring the spatio-temporal dynamics of live cells, we follow individual QD-labeled IgE receptors both on and inside rat mast cells. Trajectories of receptors on the plasma membrane reveal three dimensional, nano-scale features of the cell surface topology. During later stages of the signal transduction cascade, clusters of QD labeled IgE-FcεRI were captured in the act of ligand-mediated endocytosis and tracked during rapid (\textasciitilde{}950 nm/s) vesicular transit through the cell.},

  ABSTRACT = {Observing dynamics at the nanoscale requires submillisecond time resolution. Notably, in studying biological systems, three-dimensional (3D) trajectories of fluorescently labeled objects such as viruses or transport vesicles often need to be acquired with high temporal resolution. Here, we present a novel instrument that combines scanning-free multiplane detection at 3.2 kHz frame rate and single photon sensitivity with optimized beam-steering capabilities. This setup enables ultrafast 3D localization with submillisecond time resolution and nanometer localization precision. We demonstrate 3D tracking of single fluorescent particles at speeds of up to 150 nm/ms over several seconds and large volumes. By focused excitation of only the particle of interest, while avoiding confocal pinholes, the system realizes maximum detection efficiency at minimal laser irradiation. These features, combined with the avoidance of stage movement, provide high live-sample compatibility for future biomedical applications.},

  ABSTRACT = {We report a method for tracking individual quantum dot (QD) labeled proteins inside of live cells that uses four overlapping confocal volume elements and active feedback once every 5 milliseconds to follow three dimensional molecular motion. This method has substantial advantages over 3D molecular tracking methods based upon CCD cameras, including increased Z tracking range (10 μm demonstrated here), substantially lower excitation powers (15 μW used here), and the ability to perform time-resolved spectroscopy (such as fluorescence lifetime measurements or fluorescence correlation spectroscopy) on the molecules being tracked. In particular, we show for the first time fluorescence photon anti-bunching of individual QD labeled proteins in live cells and demonstrate the ability to track individual dye labeled nucleotides (Cy5-dUTP) at biologically relevant transport rates. To demonstrate the power of these methods for exploring the spatio-temporal dynamics of live cells, we follow individual QD-labeled IgE receptors both on and inside rat mast cells. Trajectories of receptors on the plasma membrane reveal three dimensional, nano-scale features of the cell surface topology. During later stages of the signal transduction cascade, clusters of QD labeled IgE-FcεRI were captured in the act of ligand-mediated endocytosis and tracked during rapid (\textasciitilde{}950 nm/s) vesicular transit through the cell.},

  ABSTRACT = {Three-dimensional (3D) spatial information can be encoded in two-dimensional images of fluorescent nanoparticles by astigmatic imaging. We combined this method with light sheet microscopy for high contrast single particle imaging up to 200 µm deep within living tissue and real-time image analysis to determine 3D particle localizations with nanometer precision and millisecond temporal resolution. Axial information was instantly directed to the sample stage to keep a moving particle within the focal plane in an active feedback loop. We demonstrated 3D tracking of nanoparticles at an unprecedented depth throughout large cell nuclei over several thousand frames and a range of more than 10 µm in each spatial dimension, while simultaneously acquiring optically sectioned wide field images. We conclude that this 3D particle tracking technique employing light sheet microscopy presents a valuable extension to the nanoscopy toolbox.},

  ABSTRACT = {Single particle tracking (SPT) in biological systems is a quickly growing field. Many new technologies are being developed providing new tracking capabilities, which also lead to higher demands and expectations for SPT. Following a single biomolecule as it performs its function provides quantitative mechanistic information that cannot be obtained in classical ensemble methods. From the 3D trajectory, information is available over the diffusional behavior of the particle and precise position information can also be used to elucidate interactions of the tracked particle with its surroundings. Thus, three-dimensional (3D) SPT is a very valuable tool for investigating cellular processes. This review presents recent progress in 3D SPT, from image-based techniques toward more sophisticated feedback approaches. We focus mainly on the feedback technique known as orbital tracking. We present here a modified version of the original orbital tracking in which the intensities from two z-planes are simultaneously measured allowing a concomitant wide-field imaging. The system can track single particles with a precision down to 5 nm in the x-y plane and 7 nm in the axial direction. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated using single virus tracing to follow the infection pathway of Prototype Foamy Virus in living cells.},

@ARTICLE{elliottMyosinIIControls2015,
  ABSTRACT = {In many cases, cell function is intimately linked to cell shape control. We used endothelial cell branching morphogenesis as a model to understand the role of myosin II in shape control of invasive cells migrating in 3D collagen gels. We applied principles of differential geometry and mathematical morphology to 3D image sets to parameterize cell branch structure and local cell-surface curvature. We find that Rho/ROCK-stimulated myosin II contractility minimizes cell-scale branching by recognizing and minimizing local cell-surface curvature. Using microfabrication to constrain cell shape identifies a positive feedback mechanism in which low curvature stabilizes myosin II cortical association, where it acts to maintain minimal curvature. The feedback between regulation of myosin II by curvature and control of curvature by myosin II drives cycles of localized cortical myosin II assembly and disassembly. These cycles in turn mediate alternating phases of directionally biased branch initiation and retraction to guide 3D cell migration.},

  ABSTRACT = {A number of properties of certain living embryonic tissues can be explained by considering them as liquids. Tissue fragments left in a shaker bath round up to form spherical aggregates, as do liquid drops. When cells comprising two distinct embryonic tissues are mixed, typically a nucleation-like process takes place, and one tissue sorts out from the other. The equilibrium configurations at the end of such sorting out phenomena have been interpreted in terms of tissue surface tensions arising from the adhesive interactions between individual cells. In the present study we go beyond these equilibrium properties and study the viscoelastic behavior of a number of living embryonic tissues. Using a specifically designed apparatus, spherical cell aggregates are mechanically compressed and their viscoelastic response is followed. A generalized Kelvin model of viscoelasticity accurately describes the measured relaxation curves for each of the four tissues studied. Quantitative results are obtained for the characteristic relaxation times and elastic and viscous parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the cell aggregates studied here, when subjected to mechanical deformations, relax as elastic materials on short time scales and as viscous liquids on long time scales.},

@ARTICLE{zhouActomyosinStiffensVertebrate2009,
  ABSTRACT = {Physical forces drive the movement of tissues within the early embryo. Classical and modern approaches have been used to infer and, in rare cases, measure mechanical properties and the location and magnitude of forces within embryos. Elongation of the dorsal axis is a crucial event in early vertebrate development, yet the mechanics of dorsal tissues in driving embryonic elongation that later support neural tube closure and formation of the central nervous system is not known. Among vertebrates, amphibian embryos allow complex physical manipulation of embryonic tissues that are required to measure the mechanical properties of tissues. In this paper, we measure the stiffness of dorsal isolate explants of frog (Xenopus laevis) from gastrulation to neurulation and find dorsal tissues stiffen from less than 20 Pascal (Pa) to over 80 Pa. By iteratively removing tissues from these explants, we find paraxial somitic mesoderm is nearly twice as stiff as either the notochord or neural plate, and at least 10-fold stiffer than the endoderm. Stiffness measurements from explants with reduced fibronectin fibril assembly or disrupted actomyosin contractility suggest that it is the state of the actomyosin cell cortex rather than accumulating fibronectin that controls tissue stiffness in early amphibian embryos.},

@ARTICLE{bambardekarDirectLaserManipulation2015,
  ABSTRACT = {Cell-generated forces produce a variety of tissue movements and tissue shape changes. The cytoskeletal elements that underlie these dynamics act at cell-cell and cell-ECM contacts to apply local forces on adhesive structures. In epithelia, force imbalance at cell contacts induces cell shape changes, such as apical constriction or polarized junction remodeling, driving tissue morphogenesis. The dynamics of these processes are well-characterized; however, the mechanical basis of cell shape changes is largely unknown because of a lack of mechanical measurements in vivo. We have developed an approach combining optical tweezers with light-sheet microscopy to probe the mechanical properties of epithelial cell junctions in the early Drosophila embryo. We show that optical trapping can efficiently deform cell-cell interfaces and measure tension at cell junctions, which is on the order of 100 pN. We show that tension at cell junctions equilibrates over a few seconds, a short timescale compared with the contractile events that drive morphogenetic movements. We also show that tension increases along cell interfaces during early tissue morphogenesis and becomes anisotropic as cells intercalate during germ-band extension. By performing pull-and-release experiments, we identify time-dependent properties of junctional mechanics consistent with a simple viscoelastic model. Integrating this constitutive law into a tissue-scale model, we predict quantitatively how local deformations propagate throughout the tissue.},

@ARTICLE{bonnetMechanicalStateMaterial2012,
  ABSTRACT = {During development, epithelial tissues undergo extensive morphogenesis based on coordinated changes of cell shape and position over time. Continuum mechanics describes tissue mechanical state and shape changes in terms of strain and stress. It accounts for individual cell properties using only a few spatially averaged material parameters. To determine the mechanical state and parameters in the Drosophila pupa dorsal thorax epithelium, we sever in vivo the adherens junctions around a disk-shaped domain comprising typically hundred cells. This enables a direct measurement of the strain along different orientations at once. The amplitude and anisotropy of the strain increase during development. We also measure the stress to viscosity ratio and similarly find an increase in amplitude and anisotropy. The relaxation time is of order of ten seconds. We propose a space-time, continuous model of the relaxation. Good agreement with experimental data validates the description of the epithelial domain as a continuous, linear, visco-elastic material. We discuss the relevant time and length scales. Another material parameter, the ratio of external friction to internal viscosity, is estimated by fitting the initial velocity profile. Together, our results contribute to quantify forces and displacements, and their time evolution during morphogenesis.},

  ABSTRACT = {The mechanical properties of the cellular microenvironment and their spatiotemporal variations are thought to play a central role in sculpting embryonic tissues, maintaining organ architecture and controlling cell behavior, including cell differentiation. However, no direct in vivo and in situ measurement of mechanical properties within developing 3D tissues and organs has yet been performed. Here we introduce a technique that employs biocompatible, magnetically responsive ferrofluid microdroplets as local mechanical actuators and allows quantitative spatiotemporal measurements of mechanical properties in vivo. Using this technique, we show that vertebrate body elongation entails spatially varying tissue mechanics along the anteroposterior axis. Specifically, we find that the zebrafish tailbud is viscoelastic (elastic below a few seconds and fluid after just 1 min) and displays decreasing stiffness and increasing fluidity toward its posterior elongating region. This method opens new avenues to study mechanobiology in vivo, both in embryogenesis and in disease processes, including cancer.},

@ARTICLE{zhouForceProductionMechanical2015,
  ABSTRACT = {Forces generated within the embryo during convergent extension (CE) must overcome mechanical resistance to push the head away from the rear. As mechanical resistance increases more than eightfold during CE and can vary twofold from individual to individual, we have proposed that developmental programs must include mechanical accommodation in order to maintain robust morphogenesis. To test this idea and investigate the processes that generate forces within early embryos, we developed a novel gel-based sensor to report force production as a tissue changes shape; we find that the mean stress produced by CE is 5.0±1.6 Pascal (Pa). Experiments with the gel-based force sensor resulted in three findings. (1) Force production and mechanical resistance can be coupled through myosin contractility. The coupling of these processes can be hidden unless affected tissues are challenged by physical constraints. (2) CE is mechanically adaptive; dorsal tissues can increase force production up to threefold to overcome a stiffer microenvironment. These findings demonstrate that mechanical accommodation can ensure robust morphogenetic movements against environmental and genetic variation that might otherwise perturb development and growth. (3) Force production is distributed between neural and mesodermal tissues in the dorsal isolate, and the notochord, a central structure involved in patterning vertebrate morphogenesis, is not required for force production during late gastrulation and early neurulation. Our findings suggest that genetic factors that coordinately alter force production and mechanical resistance are common during morphogenesis, and that their cryptic roles can be revealed when tissues are challenged by controlled biophysical constraints.},

  ABSTRACT = {E-cadherin is maternally expressed in most vertebrate species, but its function during early development of the vertebrate embryo proper is unknown. To directly examine E-cadherin gene (cdh1) function in zebrafish, morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) that inhibit E-cadherin protein (Cdh1) expression were injected into embryos. Cdh1 knockdown reduced embryo survival. In early cdh1 MO-injected embryos, the cleavage plane orientation between blastomeres was irregular and adhesion defects prevented normal compaction. Cdh1 knockdown inhibited epiboly cell movements. Epiboly delay caused yolk cell lysis and produced embryos with a bifurcated embryonic axis. Cdh1 knockdown inhibited gastrulation cell movements, causing defects in convergence and extension. Additionally, prechordal plate derivatives were absent in Cdh1 knockdown embryos even though presumptive prechordal plate markers were induced normally. E-cadherin mRNA coinjection demonstrated the specificity of cdh1 MO-induced defects. Our experiments illustrate the importance of cdh1 in regulating morphogenetic cell movements and tissue formation in the early embryo.},

  ABSTRACT = {The GTPases Rac1, RhoA and Cdc42 act together to control cytoskeleton dynamics1,2,3. Recent biosensor studies have shown that all three GTPases are activated at the front of migrating cells4,5,6,7, and biochemical evidence suggests that they may regulate one another: Cdc42 can activate Rac1 (ref. 8), and Rac1 and RhoA are mutually inhibitory9,10,11,12. However, their spatiotemporal coordination, at the seconds and single-micrometre dimensions typical of individual protrusion events, remains unknown. Here we examine GTPase coordination in mouse embryonic fibroblasts both through simultaneous visualization of two GTPase biosensors and using a ‘computational multiplexing’ approach capable of defining the relationships between multiple protein activities visualized in separate experiments. We found that RhoA is activated at the cell edge synchronous with edge advancement, whereas Cdc42 and Rac1 are activated 2 μm behind the edge with a delay of 40 s. This indicates that Rac1 and RhoA operate antagonistically through spatial separation and precise timing, and that RhoA has a role in the initial events of protrusion, whereas Rac1 and Cdc42 activate pathways implicated in reinforcement and stabilization of newly expanded protrusions.},

Both isoforms reside outside of protrusions and act at a distance to regulate cell protrusion, signaling, and maturation of nascent adhesions. MIIA also controls the dynamics and size of adhesions in central regions of the cell and contributes to retraction and adhesion disassembly at the rear. In contrast, MIIB establishes front-back polarity and centrosome, Golgi, and nuclear orientation. Using ATPase- and contraction-deficient mutants of both MIIA and MIIB, we show a role for MIIB-dependent actin cross-linking in establishing front-back polarity. From these studies, MII emerges as a master regulator and integrator of cell migration. It mediates each of the major component processes that drive migration, e.g., polarization, protrusion, adhesion assembly and turnover, polarity, signaling, and tail retraction, and it integrates spatially separated processes.},

@ARTICLE{witzelWnt11ControlsCell2006,
  ABSTRACT = {Wnt11 is a key signal, determining cell polarization and migration during vertebrate gastrulation. It is known that Wnt11 functionally interacts with several signaling components, the homologues of which control planar cell polarity in Drosophila melanogaster. Although in D. melanogaster these components are thought to polarize cells by asymmetrically localizing at the plasma membrane, it is not yet clear whether their subcellular localization plays a similarly important role in vertebrates. We show that in zebrafish embryonic cells, Wnt11 locally functions at the plasma membrane by accumulating its receptor, Frizzled 7, on adjacent sites of cell contacts. Wnt11-induced Frizzled 7 accumulations recruit the intracellular Wnt signaling mediator Dishevelled, as well as Wnt11 itself, and locally increase cell contact persistence. This increase in cell contact persistence is mediated by the local interaction of Wnt11, Frizzled 7, and the atypical cadherin Flamingo at the plasma membrane, and it does not require the activity of further downstream effectors of Wnt11 signaling, such as RhoA and Rok2. We propose that Wnt11, by interacting with Frizzled 7 and Flamingo, modulates local cell contact persistence to coordinate cell movements during gastrulation.},

@ARTICLE{caiMechanicalFeedbackEcadherin2014,
  ABSTRACT = {E-cadherin is a major homophilic cell-cell adhesion molecule that inhibits motility of individual cells on matrix. However, its contribution to migration of cells through cell-rich tissues is less clear. We developed an in vivo sensor of mechanical tension across E-cadherin molecules, which we combined with cell-type-specific RNAi, photoactivatable Rac, and morphodynamic profiling, to interrogate how E-cadherin contributes to collective migration of cells between other cells. Using the Drosophila ovary as a model, we found that adhesion between border cells and their substrate, the nurse cells, functions in a positive feedback loop with Rac and actin assembly to stabilize forward-directed protrusion and directionally persistent movement. Adhesion between individual border cells communicates direction from the lead cell to the followers. Adhesion between motile cells and polar cells holds the cluster together and polarizes each individual cell. Thus, E-cadherin is an integral component of the guidance mechanisms that orchestrate collective chemotaxis in vivo.},

@ARTICLE{collinsChangesEcadherinRigidity2017,
  ABSTRACT = {Mechanical cues are sensed and transduced by cell adhesion complexes to regulate diverse cell behaviors. Extracellular matrix (ECM) rigidity sensing by integrin adhesions has been well studied, but rigidity sensing by cadherins during cell adhesion is largely unexplored. Using mechanically tunable polyacrylamide (PA) gels functionalized with the extracellular domain of E-cadherin (Ecad-Fc), we showed that E-cadherin-dependent epithelial cell adhesion was sensitive to changes in PA gel elastic modulus that produced striking differences in cell morphology, actin organization, and membrane dynamics. Traction force microscopy (TFM) revealed that cells produced the greatest tractions at the cell periphery, where distinct types of actin-based membrane protrusions formed. Cells responded to substrate rigidity by reorganizing the distribution and size of high-traction-stress regions at the cell periphery. Differences in adhesion and protrusion dynamics were mediated by balancing the activities of specific signaling molecules. Cell adhesion to a 30-kPa Ecad-Fc PA gel required Cdc42- and formin-dependent filopodia formation, whereas adhesion to a 60-kPa Ecad-Fc PA gel induced Arp2/3-dependent lamellipodial protrusions. A quantitative 3D cell-cell adhesion assay and live cell imaging of cell-cell contact formation revealed that inhibition of Cdc42, formin, and Arp2/3 activities blocked the initiation, but not the maintenance of established cell-cell adhesions. These results indicate that the same signaling molecules activated by E-cadherin rigidity sensing on PA gels contribute to actin organization and membrane dynamics during cell-cell adhesion. We hypothesize that a transition in the stiffness of E-cadherin homotypic interactions regulates actin and membrane dynamics during initial stages of cell-cell adhesion.},

@ARTICLE{harrisCharacterizingMechanicsCultured2012,
  ABSTRACT = {One-cell-thick monolayers are the simplest tissues in multicellular organisms, yet they fulfill critical roles in development and normal physiology. In early development, embryonic morphogenesis results largely from monolayer rearrangement and deformation due to internally generated forces. Later, monolayers act as physical barriers separating the internal environment from the exterior and must withstand externally applied forces. Though resisting and generating mechanical forces is an essential part of monolayer function, simple experimental methods to characterize monolayer mechanical properties are lacking. Here, we describe a system for tensile testing of freely suspended cultured monolayers that enables the examination of their mechanical behavior at multi-, uni-, and subcellular scales. Using this system, we provide measurements of monolayer elasticity and show that this is two orders of magnitude larger than the elasticity of their isolated cellular components. Monolayers could withstand more than a doubling in length before failing through rupture of intercellular junctions. Measurement of stress at fracture enabled a first estimation of the average force needed to separate cells within truly mature monolayers, approximately ninefold larger than measured in pairs of isolated cells. As in single cells, monolayer mechanical properties were strongly dependent on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton, myosin, and intercellular adhesions interfacing adjacent cells. High magnification imaging revealed that keratin filaments became progressively stretched during extension, suggesting they participate in monolayer mechanics. This multiscale study of monolayer response to deformation enabled by our device provides the first quantitative investigation of the link between monolayer biology and mechanics.},

  ABSTRACT = {We have investigated the mechanical properties of fibroblast cells after adding the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin and the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 by atomic force microscopy (AFM). We have observed a decrease in the elastic modulus from a value of around 20 kPa down to a value around 8 kPa on a time scale of around 30-60 min when applying the myosin inhibitor blebbistatin, whereas the Y-27632 did not show any prominent mechanical effects. From topographic images, we can conclude that, after adding blebbistatin, actin filaments are not visible any more, whereas Y-27632 did not show any prominent effects in cell morphology. This study shows that tension generated by myosin contributes to the cellular stiffness and thus can be observed by measuring the elastic modulus of cells.},

  ABSTRACT = {The cellular cytoskeleton is crucial for many cellular functions such as cell motility and wound healing, as well as other processes that require shape change or force generation. Actin is one cytoskeleton component that regulates cell mechanics. Important properties driving this regulation include the amount of actin, its level of cross-linking, and its coordination with the activity of specific molecular motors like myosin. While studies investigating the contribution of myosin activity to cell mechanics have been performed on cells attached to a substrate, we investigated mechanical properties of cells in suspension. To do this, we used multiple probes for cell mechanics including a microfluidic optical stretcher, a microfluidic microcirculation mimetic, and real-time deformability cytometry. We found that nonadherent blood cells, cells arrested in mitosis, and naturally adherent cells brought into suspension, stiffen and become more solidlike upon myosin inhibition across multiple timescales (milliseconds to minutes). Our results hold across several pharmacological and genetic perturbations targeting myosin. Our findings suggest that myosin II activity contributes to increased whole-cell compliance and fluidity. This finding is contrary to what has been reported for cells attached to a substrate, which stiffen via active myosin driven prestress. Our results establish the importance of myosin II as an active component in modulating suspended cell mechanics, with a functional role distinctly different from that for substrate-adhered cells.},

@ARTICLE{nakamuraFilGAPItsClose2013,
  ABSTRACT = {Cell migration, phagocytosis and cytokinesis are mechanically intensive cellular processes that are mediated by the dynamic assembly and contractility of the actin cytoskeleton. GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) control activities of the Rho family proteins including Cdc42, Rac1 and RhoA, which are prominent upstream regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. The present review concerns a class of Rho GAPs, FilGAP (ARHGAP24 gene product) and its close relatives (ARHGAP22 and AHRGAP25 gene products). FilGAP is a GAP for Rac1 and a binding partner of FLNa (filamin A), a widely expressed F-actin (filamentous actin)-cross-linking protein that binds many different proteins that are important in cell regulation. Phosphorylation of FilGAP serine/threonine residues and binding to FLNa modulate FilGAP's GAP activity and, as a result, its ability to regulate cell protrusion and spreading. FLNa binds to FilGAP at F-actin-enriched sites, such as at the leading edge of the cell where Rac1 activity is controlled to inhibit actin assembly. FilGAP then dissociates from FLNa in actin networks by myosin-dependent mechanical deformation of FLNa's FilGAP-binding site to relocate at the plasma membrane by binding to polyphosphoinositides. Since actomyosin contraction is activated downstream of RhoA-ROCK (Rho-kinase), RhoA activity regulates Rac1 through FilGAP by signalling to the force-generating system. FilGAP and the ARHGAP22 gene product also act as mediators between RhoA and Rac1 pathways, which lead to amoeboid and mesenchymal modes of cell movements respectively. Therefore FilGAP and its close relatives are key regulators that promote the reciprocal inhibitory relationship between RhoA and Rac1~in cell shape changes and the mesenchymal-amoeboid transition in tumour cells.},

@ARTICLE{solonFibroblastAdaptationStiffness2007,
  ABSTRACT = {Many cell types alter their morphology and gene expression profile when grown on chemically equivalent surfaces with different rigidities. One expectation of this change in morphology and composition is that the cell's internal stiffness, governed by cytoskeletal assembly and production of internal stresses, will change as a function of substrate stiffness. Atomic force microscopy was used to measure the stiffness of fibroblasts grown on fibronectin-coated polyacrylamide gels of shear moduli varying between 500 and 40,000 Pa. Indentation measurements show that the cells' elastic moduli were equal to, or slightly lower than, those of their substrates for a range of soft gels and reached a saturating value at a substrate rigidity of 20 kPa. The amount of cross-linked F-actin sedimenting at low centrifugal force also increased with substrate stiffness. Together with enhanced actin polymerization and cross-linking, active contraction of the cytoskeleton can also modulate stiffness by exploiting the nonlinear elasticity of semiflexible biopolymer networks. These results suggest that within a range of stiffness spanning that of soft tissues, fibroblasts tune their internal stiffness to match that of their substrate, and modulation of cellular stiffness by the rigidity of the environment may be a mechanism used to direct cell migration and wound repair.},

The necessary elements are spatially structured illumination light and a nonlinear dependence of the fluorescence emission rate on the illumination intensity. As an example of this concept, this article experimentally demonstrates saturated structured-illumination microscopy, a recently proposed method in which the nonlinearity arises from saturation of the excited state. This method can be used in a simple, wide-field (nonscanning) microscope, uses only a single, inexpensive laser, and requires no unusual photophysical properties of the fluorophore. The practical resolving power is determined by the signal-to-noise ratio, which in turn is limited by photobleaching. Experimental results show that a 2D point resolution of {$<$}50 nm is possible on sufficiently bright and photostable samples.},

  ABSTRACT = {During development cells interact mechanically with their microenvironment through cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. Many proteins involved in these adhesions serve both mechanical and signaling roles. In this review we will focus on the mechanical roles of these proteins and their complexes in transmitting force or stress from cell to cell or from cell to the extracellular matrix. As forces operate against tissues they establish tissue architecture, extracellular matrix assembly, and pattern cell shapes. As tissues become more established, adhesions play a major role integrating cells with the mechanics of their local environment. Adhesions may serve as both a molecular-specific glue, holding defined populations of cells together, and as a lubricant, allowing tissues to slide past one another. We review the biophysical principles and experimental tools used to study adhesion so that we may aid efforts to understand how adhesions guide these movements and integrate their signaling functions with mechanical function. As we conclude we review efforts to develop predictive models of adhesion that can be used to interpret experiments and guide future efforts to control and direct the process of tissue self-assembly during development.},

  ABSTRACT = {A novel method for detection of noble-metal nanoparticles by their nonlinear optical properties is presented and applied for specific labeling of cellular organelles. When illuminated by laser light in resonance with their plasmon frequency these nanoparticles generate an enhanced multiphoton signal. This enhanced signal is measured to obtain a depth-resolved image in a laser scanning microscope setup. Plasmon-resonance images of both live and fixed cells, showing specific labeling of cellular organelles and membranes, either by two-photon autofluorescence or by third-harmonic generation, are presented.},

When the light intensity was high enough, magnetic nanoparticles were removed from the beam center and formed a dark ring. The same behavior was observed when focusing vortex or Bessel beams. The interactions between two or more separated rings of magnetic nanoparticles created by independent optical traps were also observed.},

@ARTICLE{albert-smetApplicationsLightSheetMicroscopy2019,
  ABSTRACT = {Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) has been present in cell biology laboratories for quite some time, mainly as custom-made systems, with imaging applications ranging from single cells (in the micrometer scale) to small organisms (in the millimeter scale). Such microscopes distinguish themselves for having very low phototoxicity levels and high spatial and temporal resolution, properties that make them ideal for a large range of applications, including the study of dynamic processes in cell biology. In particular, cellular motion has proven to be essential in biological processes such as tumor metastasis and tissue development. Experimental setups make extensive use of microdevices (bioMEMS) that provide better control over the substrate environment than traditional cell culture experiments. For example, to mimic in vivo conditions, experiment biochemical dynamics, and trap, move or count cells. Microdevices provide higher degrees of empirical complexity but, so far, most have been designed to be imaged through wide-field or confocal microscopes. However, the properties of LSFM render it ideal for 3D characterization of active cells. When working with microdevices, confocal microscopy is more widespread than LSFM even though it suffers from higher phototoxicity and slower acquisition speeds. Although it is sometimes possible to illuminate with a light sheet microdevices designed for confocal microscopes, these bioMEMS must be redesigned to exploit the full potential of LSFM. These properties are essential to image phenomena such as motion and traction, differentiation, and diffusion of molecules more frequently on a wider scale. The use of microdevices for LSFM has extended beyond cell tracking studies into experiments regarding cytometry, spheroid cultures and lab-on-a-chip automation. Due to light sheet microscopy being in its early stages, a setup of these characteristics demands some degree of optical expertise; and designing three-dimensional microdevices requires facilities, ingenuity and experience in microfabrication. In this paper, we explore different approaches where light sheet microscopy can achieve single-cell and subcellular resolution within microdevices, and provide a few pointers on how these experiments may be improved.},

  ABSTRACT = {We have developed a new open-top selective plane illumination microscope (SPIM) compatible with microfluidic devices, multi-well plates, and other sample formats used in conventional inverted microscopy. Its key element is a water prism that compensates for the aberrations introduced when imaging at 45 degrees through a coverglass. We have demonstrated its unique high-content imaging capability by recording Drosophila embryo development in environmentally-controlled microfluidic channels and imaging zebrafish embryos in 96-well plates. We have also shown the imaging of C. elegans and moving Drosophila larvae on coverslips.},

@ARTICLE{ponjavicSensitiveLightsheetMicroscopy2018,
  ABSTRACT = {We present a sensitive inverted light sheet microscope, capable of single-molecule fluorescence imaging of cells in 96-well plates. Light sheet microscope designs are often complex and costly, requiring custom-made sample chambers that are incompatible with standard cell culture samples. To overcome this limitation, we have developed single-objective cantilever selective plane illumination microscopy (socSPIM), which introduces a light sheet through the objective lens of an inverted microscope using an AFM tip. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this setup by performing 3D imaging of nuclear pore complexes, as well as live whole-cell 3D imaging of lysosomes and super-resolution imaging of the T-cell membrane. The unique advantage offered by socSPIM is the minimal footprint of the cantilever, which allowed us to perform super-resolution reflected light-sheet microscopy by PAINT in 96-well plates, paving the way for high-throughput studies.},
