%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% abstract %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

We present a tomographic reconstruction algorithm, which is applied to Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) [1] images, that is robust to mechanical jitter and systematic angular and spatial drift.
OPT relies on precise mechanical rotation and is less mechanically stable than large scale CT scanning systems, leading to reconstruction artefacts.
The algorithm uses multiple (5+) tracked fiducial beads to recover the sample pose and the image rays are then back-projected at each orientation.
The quality of the image reconstruction using the proposed algorithm shows an improvement when compared to the Radon transform.
When adding a systematic spatial and angular mechanical drift, the reconstruction using the proposed algorithm shows a significant improvement over the Radon transform.

% %Orthogonal imaging schema can be replaced with pass through imaging provide samples are sufficiently transparent.
% %Instead of scanning these samples laterally one can rotate their sample and reconstruct a full three dimensional image.
% %As tomographic technology has been shrunk to the millimeter scale, errors induced by hardware become apparent.

% tomographic reconstruction relies
% heavily on precision movement and rotation.
% %This chapter addresses a key downside in traditional approaches to performing full three dimensional reconstructions tomographically.
% Here an algorithm will be presented that relies exclusively on multiple (4+) tracked fiducial beads to enable accurate reconstruction even with systematic mechanical drift.
% It will be demonstrated on ground truth simulated testcard image data with motion errors compounded onto the tomographic rotation.
% These motion errors will include systematic mechanical drift, giving a spiral path; and angular drift giving precession.

%Well establishjed
%Three-dimensional imaging of anatomy in thick biological samples provides valuable data for developmental biology studies.
%Tomographic techniques that generate 3D reconstructions from 2D images such as computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential in medical applications to visualize morphology in large tissues and organs.
%CT and especially micro-CT can achieve micron-scale resolution using certain contrast agents, however the high doses of radiation used make this unsuitable for repeated experiments on a biological sample.
%Micro-MRI can also achieve resolution in the micron scale, however the cost and size of MRI instruments can be prohibitive for many applications[21].
%Furthermore, neither of these techniques can exploit the plethora of information that can be extracted through fluorescence microscopy.

Sharpe~\emph{et.al} proposed \gls{OPT}~\cite{sharpeOpticalProjectionTomography2002}
using visible light to image transparent or translucent mesoscopic samples, with micrometer resolution.
\gls{OPT} addresses the scale gap between photographic techniques (for samples typically larger than \SI{10}{\milli\meter}), and light microscopy techniques (samples smaller than \SI{1}{\milli\meter}) to image biological samples in the \SIrange{1}{10}{\milli\meter} regime.
% \gls{OPT} is non-invasive optically but may require specialist invasive preparation for its samples.

%Optical Projection Tomography was first proposed by Sharpe in 2002 [30]; it uses visible light to image and create volumetric data of transparent (naturally or artificially) mesoscopic objects (1 - 10 mm) at micron-level resolution.

\gls{OPT} is based on computerised tomography techniques~\cite{kakPrinciplesComputerizedTomographic2001} in which a set of projections of a specimen are imaged as the specimen travels through a full rotation.
Typically a Radon transform used to then transform this set of images into a 3D image stack in Cartesian (\(X,Y,Z\)).
%A cross-sectional stack of slices from the original object is reconstructed using a back-projection algorithm from the projection images.
The \gls{Radon transform} relies heavily on the assumption of circular motion with constant angular steps about a vertical axis.
This work presents an improved reconstruction algorithm that is robust to spatial and angular mechanical drifts during acquisitions, as well as inconsistent angular steps

% There are two imaging modalities for \gls{OPT}, \gls{eOPT} and \gls{tOPT}.
% In \gls{eOPT}, a fluorescent sample is excited using an illumination source off axis to the detection, similar to \gls{light-sheet} but the entire \gls{depth of field} of the detection of objective is illuminated.
% % without the excitation being shaped into a sheet.
% Scattered illumination photons are rejected at the detector using an appropriate filter.
% In tOPT, a white-light source with a diffuser and a collimator is placed along the optical axis to provide near-collimated, uniform illumination onto the sample for transmission to a detector opposite (see \figurename~\ref{fig:OPT_digram}).
% Each \gls{photosite} at the detector corresponds to a ray that has passed through the sample and been attenuated by the sample.
% The \gls{eOPT} and \gls{tOPT} modes can work in unison to provide contextual information, with the transmission images indicating overall structure (optical density of absorption or scattering) which can be supplemented by the fluorescent signal from a label of interest.

\section{Stereoscopic imaging}

%\subsection{Projective geometry}

%Camera imaging is governed by projective geometry
%Parallel lines project onto a camera will have a vanishing point at the horizon.

%\subsection{Camera projections}

%\todo{Camera projections \ lecture notes 3}

The stereoscopic imaging scenes allows for the triangulation of individual features in three dimensional space (know as world points) when the features or fiducial markers in one detector are uniquely identifiable. %(such as fluorescent beads).
Triangulation requires that each feature is detected in both images of a stereo imaging system, and for these detections to be correctly associated with one another: this is known as the correspondence problem.
Many methods exist to ensure that features are detected from image data and accurately associated between two cameras or views.
Properties of scale independent features and their surrounding pixel environment in one image can be matched to a similar feature in the second image.

%TODO ADD SOME STEREOIMAGING STUFF?

  }\label{fig:epi-polar-geom}
\end{figure}

%TODO INSERT H E F DEFINTIONS
Coordinates in two adjaceent views with a common epi-pole (see Figure~\ref{fig:epi-polar-geom}) are related by the Essential matrix (\gls{Essential}) for uncalibrated cameras and the Fundamental matrix (\gls{F}) or calibrated cameras as described:
\begin{gather}
\gls{p'}^T \gls{Essential} \gls{p} = 0 \label{eq:pEp}\\
\gls{Essential} = \gls{K'}^T \gls{F} \gls{K} %= \gls{T_x} \gls{R} = \mathbf{U}\Lambda \mathbf{V}^T%\gls{R} = U\LambdaV^T\\
\end{gather}
Where \(K\) is a matrix which converts image plane coordinates to camera pixel coordinates and where \gls{p} refers to a point in the image plane.

\section{The proposed algorithm}

%The rotation may also not be orthogonal to the plane of detection.
The shift of a camera around a scene separated by a transformation matrix (\( \begin{bmatrix}[c|c] \gls{R} & \gls{T} \end{bmatrix}\)) is analogous to transforming the sample in the fixed view of an imaging detector, as in an \gls{OPT} acquisition.
During an ideal \gls{OPT} acquisition, a marker will appear to follow an elliptical path in the \(xy\) camera plane.
During the following volume reconstruction there is a fitting step to recover the path of the fiducial marker, which is used to apply as a correction before using the inverse \gls{Radon transform}.
This type of reconstruction not only ignores any mechanical jitter of the sample but also any affine, systematic, mechanical drift (in \(X,Y,Z,\theta,\phi,\psi \)). %TODO is this true?

Using two adjacent images of a scene, separated by some rotation and translation, world points in 3D space may be triangulated within the scene given the rotational and translational matrices of the respective camera views.

% The inverse is also possible, given a sufficient number of known fiducial points in a scene the translation and rotation matrices can be recovered.

% The recovery of a more exact description of the motion of the scene can eliminate any need for a fitting and may recover and correct for drift, as well as eliminate any mechanical jitter.
% Errors may however then be introduced from fiducial markers mechanically slipping and localisation errors.
% Fiducial markers in this sense refer to an accurately locatable marker common through different views in a sample.

Once a sufficient amount of fiducial markers are reliably tracked from the first to the second image, any of the \glslink{fundamental matrix}{fundamental}, \glslink{essential matrix}{essential} matrices can be computed.
Using the factorisation one of these matrixes, between each adjacent view of a rotating scene, the translation and rotational matrices can be recovered.
% Here we will discuss a reconstruction using \gls{F} but the same principle applies for \gls{Essential} and \gls{H}.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{./figures/flOPT_principle}
  \caption[Principles of the proposed algorithm]{Principles of the proposed algorithm. Each successive frame of \gls{OPT} image data will have an associated \gls{R} and \gls{T} (shown here in augmented form using homogenous coordinates), these matrices can be recovered from comparing the fiducial marker positions in each frame (\(n\)) and its successor (\(n+1\)).}
\end{figure}

% Here are two ways of reconstructing using the fundamental matrix as described above.
To reconstruct we compute \gls{F} for the current image and the first image using 5 or more fiducial markers; having additional beads helps to remove ambiguity and increase confidence in \gls{F}.
Once \gls{F} is calculated \gls{F} is then decomposed into \(\gls{R}_n\) and \(\gls{T}_n\) between each view \(n\) and \(n+1\).
The image at view \(n+1\) is then back projected along the virtual optical axis within a virtual volume where the sample will be reconstructed.
The size of this back projection and virtual volume is chosen to be suitably large (so that important data is not lost).
% Then, all the prior rotation and translation matrices are serially multiplied from \(\begin{bmatrix}[c|c] \gls{R}_0&\gls{T}_0 \end{bmatrix}\) until \(\begin{bmatrix}[c|c] \gls{R}_n&\gls{T}_n \end{bmatrix}\) % \([R_n|T_n] \)
% , this final matrix is inverted and applied to the back projected volume.
The transformation matrices that are recovered are then inverted to realign the back projection of the image rays in the volume to their respective source positions.
% This process is repeated for every angle the sum of these ray projection volumes is filtered using a high-pass filter; here a \gls{Ram-Lak filter} is used.
% \footnote{Linear real (amplitude) ramp filter in Fourier space}. %: \(|v|\)}
% By producing a series of transformation matrices from adjacent acquisitions, errors compound and the reconstruction of volumes degrades with more projections, see \figurename~\ref{fig:irandons}.

    (\subref{fig:flopt_algorithm_forward}): The \(n\) projections of the object (\(\Sigma \)), at rotation (\(\gls{R}_1\) to \(\gls{R}_n\)) and translation (\(\gls{T}_1\) to \(\gls{T}_n\)), produces \(n\) frames of image data.

    (\subref{fig:flopt_algorithm_inverse}): In the reconstruction algorithm, the rotational and translational matrices are recovered (\(\gls{R}_1'\) to \(\gls{R}_n'\) and \(\gls{T}_1'\) to \(\gls{T}_n'\)) from triangulation of the fiducial markers.

    % and inversely applied
    % to align back project the datasets,

\end{figure}

% The second approach is robust against compound errors but an additional programatic step is needed to know which beads in the first image correspond to beads in the \(n^{\text{th}}\) image.
% This can be is achieved using tracking and momentum particle tracking algorithms, though confounding issues can arise i.e.~if a particle orbits too far away from the imaging plane or occlusions occur.

In both cases a decomposed \gls{F} matrix will produce four possible transformation pairs (\gls{R},\gls{T}; \gls{R},-\gls{T}; -\gls{R},\gls{T}; -\gls{R},-\gls{T}). %TODO look this up.
Once the transformation matrix between the current view and the first view is calculated the proceeding transformation matrices are then easily chosen by similarity to the previous collected matrix and general direction of motion.
An example of this type of selection would be:
\begin{align}
\min_{I(n)}\left[I(n) = \left(\begin{bmatrix}[c|c] \gls{R}_n&\gls{T}_n \end{bmatrix} - \begin{bmatrix}[c|c] \gls{R}_{n-1}&\gls{T}_{n-1} \end{bmatrix}\right)^2\right]
\end{align}
The first two views are more difficult to choose the correct decomposition for, but it is possible if a suitable ideal matrix is given as a comparison.
Such an ideal matrix is composed using \emph{a priori} knowledge of the likely angle of rotation of the system's imaging properties.

\section{Verification of the proposed algorithm}

To verify that the proposed algorithm successfully reconstructs the specimen%as theorised
, it was applied to a volume of simulated data.
The image of Lena with an orthogonal image of cameraman
% \footnote{Standard reference image data
% % The image of Lena is used as a reference to a very early full colour digital scanner.
% % The researchers in question realised that their presentation of the scanner's capabilities at a conference lacked a test image.
% % The nearest image to hand was a Playboy magazine with Lena Söderberg as the centrefold.
% }
is used here as a testcard volume to verify the validity of the reconstruction.
Superimposed on Lena are fiducial beads to track the rotation of the image, see \figurename~\ref{fig:raw_input}.
The reference image was then rotated through \SI{128} angles over \(2\pi \) radians and projected along the \(Y\) axis and a slice in (\(X,Y\)) was taken to create a single line projection, shown three dimensionally in \figurename~\ref{fig:recon_iterative}.
This is repeated for each angle with each line projection stacked to create a sinugram, see \figurename~\ref{fig:sinugram_stretch}.

\end{figure}

In the standard approach for \gls{OPT} reconstruction, the \gls{sinugram} undergoes the inverse \gls{Radon transform}, as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:iradon_nofilter} and then post-filtering, see \figurename~\ref{fig:iradon_filter}.
This step is substituted for the proposed algorithm; in \figurename~\ref{fig:flopt_comparison_line_profile} the two techniques are compared for ideal conditions of smooth, predictable rotation.
The proposed algorithm produces %(see )
a faithful reconstruction on the original image, as shown in \figurename~\ref{fig:flopt_filter} %with some minor deviations.
Both techniques lose some of the original contrast of the object due to under-sampling of rotations.
When taking the histogram of the absolute pixel-wise difference between the original source image to the images produced by the new algorithm and the \gls{Radon transform},
% there is good overlap between the two,
see \figurename~\ref{fig:flopt_histogram}.
The mean square errors (\gls{MSE}, see Equation~\eqref{eq:mse}) of the new algorithm and the \gls{Radon transform} are \SI{15.01}{\percent} and \SI{14.84}{\percent} respectively, see \figurename~\ref{fig:flopt_histogram} for a histogram of a pixel-wise comparison.
This suggests that the new algorithm is producing an accurate reconstruction of the object, similar to the standard \gls{Radon transform}.
%, see \figurename~\ref{fig:flopt_histogram}

\begin{align}
    \operatorname{\gls{MSE}}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{(Y_i-\hat{Y_i})}^2 \label{eq:mse} % \intertext{Where \(\hat{Y_i}\) is the ith value and Y_i }

\end{figure}

%However, the proposed algorithm fairs worse in terms of contrast compared to a \gls{Radon transform}.

The more challenging case of a sample drifting, with a constant velocity and systematically along the \(X\) axis was then considered; this produced a helical path of a single fiducial within the sample, see \figurename~\ref{fig:flopt_helix_sinugram}.
In \figurename~\ref{fig:unfilttered_reconstruction_helix_iradon}, the \gls{Radon transform} entirely fails to produce a recognisable reproduction of the test image with the addition of a slight helicity to the rotation.
The proposed algorithm produces an equivalent result to that of a sample rotating without any systematic drift, see \figurename~\ref{fig:iradon_filter}.
In \figurename~\ref{fig:helical_comparison} the respective images from each algorithm were compared, as before, while the helical shift was incremented.
See \figurename~\ref{fig:flopt_helix_sinugram} for a \gls{sinugram} of a sample whereby a helical shift has been induced.
When using correlation as a metric of reproduction quality, at zero helicity, the new algorithm fairs slightly worse at \SI{94}{\percent} correlation compared to the \gls{Radon transform} at \SI{96}{\percent}.
As expected, the \gls{Radon transform} rapidly deteriorates once a systematic drift is applied; whereas the new algorithm maintains the quality of the reconstruction, see \figurename~\ref{fig:helical_comparison}.

\subsection{Recovery of R and T using matrix decomposition}

To quantitatively verify that the matrix decomposition technique was valid and robust, the accuracy of the reproduction of \gls{R} and \gls{T} was tested directly.
The original \gls{R} and \gls{T} matrices were computed and compared to \gls{R} and \gls{T} generated from matrix decomposition, this absolute difference was computed element-wise in each matrix and then an average for each matrix was taken.
Overall, the worst case scenario produced a percentage error of \SI{2}{\percent} (see \figurename~\ref{fig:pc_sum_decompose} for full statistics).
The accuracy of the calculated \gls{R} and \gls{T} did deteriorate when adding in additional degrees of combined movement, but with no correlation between the degree of helicity and the error produced.
% but the severity of this movement appeared to no trending effect.
Consistently the translational matrix (\gls{T}) was more accurately reproduced, this is likely due to there being fewer of degrees of freedom for errors to spread over.

%The images produced are a more faithful reproduction of the source image as the degree of helicity is increased.
%This effect may be due to the additional sampling induced by adding another degree of movement, that is the systematic drift.

\section{Discussion}

A new algorithm for reconstructing OPT data has been demonstrated.
The new algorithm uses multiple fiducial markers to recover the matrix which describes the rotation and translation of the sample.
The quality of the reconstructions when compared to the standard \gls{Radon transform} shows a slight improvement, with a great effect when a systematic drift is introduced.
The accuracy of the decomposition of \gls{F} into \gls{R} and \gls{T} were compared to the ground truth matrices.
The element-wise absolute difference \(\left(\frac{x-y}{2(x+y)}\right)\) of each matrix was averaged across the matrix for \gls{R} and \gls{T}.
In the worst case scenario a maximum of \SI{2}{\percent} average absolute difference was found between ground truth and recovered matrices,
% When comparing the
% expected matrices to the recovered matrices a
% ground truth matrices to the recovered matrices were compared using the average of the element-wise using square differences
% peak of \SI{2}{\percent} difference is found between the two when considering worst case scenarios;
suggesting the technique is robust to various forms of drift and general instability.
Such an algorithm could be used to help in minimising ghosting effects seen in real samples; particularly in samples where slipping is likely to occur such as in gels or in cheaper \gls{OPT} systems which tend to be more mechanically unstable and imprecise.

\section{Conclusions}

The theory backing the proposed algorithm relies on triangulation between two view points.
In this work the two view points refer to the image at frames \(n\) and \(n+1\).
However, it is possible to use three separate views (frames \(n\), \(n+1\) and \(n+2\)) to reconstruct a scene, one such approach being quaternion tensors.
Working with tensors is computationally and mathematically more challenging, but a future iteration of the algorithm presented here may benefit from using three views to provide a more accurate transformation matrix.
Beyond three views there currently is no mathematical framework at present for four or more views.
If such tools did exist, it may be possible to make the algorithm described above as non-iterative and essentially a single shot reconstruction from pixels to voxels.

% In computer vision, scenes often do not contain known fiducial marks and so such marks are found between views.
Fiducial markers could also be extracted from the image texture alone, circumventing the need for for the additional beads embedded in the sample.
To find such a correspondences, points with similar local texture are found and matched in between each image using standard algorithms such as SIFT and RANSAC. %, many of these such correspondences are found
This was attempted however the errors introduced into the transformation matrices appear to make the approach currently untenable.
% This technique is only valid for views with small angles between them, as would be found in \gls{OPT}.

\section{Introduction}
Adherence to the specifications listed in this template is essential for efficient review and publication of submissions. Proper reference format is especially important (see Section \ref{sec:refs}).

\section{Multiple corresponding authors}

There are two options for indicating multiple corresponding authorship, and they are formatted quite differently. The first format would be as follows and uses an asterisk to denote one of the authors:

\begin{verbatim}
\author{Author One\authormark{1,3} and Author Two\authormark{2,4,*}}

\address{\authormark{1}Peer Review, Publications Department,
Optical Society of America, 2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW,
Washington, DC 20036, USA\\
\authormark{2}Publications Department, Optical Society of America,
2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\\
\authormark{3}xyz@osa.org}

\email{\authormark{*}opex@osa.org}
\end{verbatim}

This format will generate the following appearance:

\medskip

\author{Author One\authormark{1,3} and Author Two\authormark{2,4,*}}

\address{\authormark{1}Peer Review, Publications Department,
Optical Society of America, 2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW,

2010 Massachusetts Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20036, USA\\
\authormark{3}xyz@osa.org}

\email{\authormark{*}opex@osa.org}

\medskip

The second format forgoes the asterisk and sets all email addresses equally within the affiliations. Please note that this format does not use the \verb+\email{}+ field at all.
\begin{verbatim}
\author{Author One\authormark{1,3} and Author Two\authormark{2,4}}

\section{Abstract}
The abstract should be limited to approximately 100 words.
%It should be an explicit summary of the paper that states the problem, the methods used, and the major results and conclusions. It also should contain the relevant key words that would allow it to be found in a cursory computerized search.
If the work of another author is cited in the abstract, that citation should be written out without a number, (e.g., journal, volume, first page, and year in square brackets [Opt. Express {\bfseries 22}, 1234 (2014)]), and a separate citation should be included in the body of the text. The first reference cited in the main text must be [1]. Do not include numbers, bullets, or lists inside the abstract.

\section{Assessing final manuscript length}
OSA's Universal Manuscript Template is based on the OSA Express layout and will provide an accurate length estimate for Optics Express, Biomedical Optics Express,  Optical Materials Express, and OSA's newest title OSA Continuum. Applied Optics, JOSAA, JOSAB, Optics Letters, Optica, and Photonics Research publish articles in a two-column layout. To estimate the final page count in a two-column layout, multiply the manuscript page count (in increments of 1/4 page) by 60\%. For example, 11.5 pages in the OSA Universal Manuscript Template are roughly equivalent to 7 composed two-column pages. Note that the estimate is only an approximation, as treatment of figure sizing, equation display, and other aspects can vary greatly across manuscripts. Authors of Letters may use the legacy template for a more accurate length estimate.

\section{Figures, tables, and supplemental materials}

\subsection{Figures and tables}

OSA encourages authors to submit color figures with their manuscripts. Figures and tables should be placed in the body of the manuscript. Standard \LaTeX{} environments should be used to place tables and figures:

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=7cm]{osafig1}
\caption{Sample caption (Fig. 2, \cite{Yelin:03}).}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Supplementary materials in OSA journals}

OSA journals allow authors to include supplementary materials as integral parts of a manuscript. Such materials are subject to peer-review procedures along with the rest of the paper and should be uploaded and described using OSA's Prism manuscript system. Please see the \href{http://www.osapublishing.org/submit/style/multimedia.cfm}{Author Guidelines for Supplementary Materials in OSA Journals} for further information.

Supplementary materials must be associated with a figure, table, or equation, OR be referenced in the results section of the manuscript. Please note that to create text color for supplementary materials links, use of the command \\
\verb|\textcolor{urlblue}{Visualization 1}| is preferred to using the command\\
\verb|\url{Visualization 1}|.

\section{References}
\label{sec:refs}
Proper formatting of references is extremely important, not only for consistent appearance but also for accurate electronic tagging. Please follow the guidelines provided below on formatting, callouts, and use of Bib\TeX.

\subsection{Formatting reference items}
Each source must have its own reference number. Footnotes (notes at the bottom of text pages) are not used in OSA journals. References require all author names, full titles, and inclusive pagination. Examples of common reference types can be found on the  \href{http://www.osapublishing.org/submit/style/style_traditional_journals.cfm} {Author and Reviewer Resource Center}.


The commands \verb+\begin{thebibliography}{}+ and \verb+\end{thebibliography}+ format the section according to standard style, showing the title {\bfseries References}.  Use the \verb+\bibitem{label}+ command to start each reference.

\subsection{Formatting reference citations}
References should be numbered consecutively in the order in which they are referenced in the body of the paper. Set reference callouts with standard \verb+\cite{}+ command or set manually inside square brackets [1].

To reference multiple articles at once, simply use a comma to separate the reference labels, e.g. \verb+\cite{Yelin:03,Masajada:13,Zhang:14}+, produces \cite{Yelin:03,Masajada:13,Zhang:14}.
%Using the \texttt{cite.sty} package will make these citations appear like so: [2--4].

\subsection{Bib\TeX}
\label{sec:bibtex}
Bib\TeX{} may be used to create a file containing the references, whose contents (i.e., contents of \texttt{.bbl} file) can then be pasted into the bibliography section of the \texttt{.tex} file. A Bib\TeX{} style file, \texttt{osajnl.bst}, is provided.

\section{Conclusion}
After proofreading the manuscript, compress your .tex manuscript file and all figures (which should be in EPS or PDF format) in a ZIP, TAR or TAR-GZIP package. All files must be referenced at the root level (e.g., file \texttt{figure-1.eps}, not \texttt{/myfigs/figure-1.eps}). If there are supplementary materials, the associated files should not be included in your manuscript archive but be uploaded separately through the Prism interface.
